This is the most postmodern war ever. No-one talks about the actual war but just the perception outsiders have about the war. It almost feels like the fighters themselves are insignificant compared to the social media war.

ANYWAYS that’s why this war is so polarizing people have chosen their camps and are going to spin the narrative in the best way possible to fit their worldview. For most people on the left it’s that the IDF is a genocidal war mongering brutalist regime that’s on a mission to kill every Palestinian with dictator like efficiency. Every article you read that leans hard left will support this. There is almost no room for nuance and you’ll be ousted by your own party for saying “wait a minute that doesn’t make sense”.

Baudrillard wrote an essay on the Gulf War as the first hyperreal was due to the heavily controlled narrative that the US government allowed.  We've since seen that in just about every war since and we've seen heavy social media narratives since Afghanistan.

Beginning around the late 00s, I noticed the media shifted from covering this conflict normally to becoming the Palestinians’ lawyers. Now they start with the conclusion that Israel is wrong and work backwards to fill in the reasoning.

The craziest thing is that this is against international law. Under international law, if an enemy combatant is using a civilian "safe place" for military purposes, then that location ceases to be treated as a such and is allowed to viewed as a valid military target by the other side. This law is put specifically in place to discourage the practice of using civilian "safe places" for military purposes.

Israel's taken out about all the senior leadership outside of Rafah, so it's mostly only kids and morons left, usually both. Largely, they don't have anyone left who knows how to run a war; their tunnel network is shot to pieces (and if parts of it are intact, are you willing to bet your life that the IDF hasn't found it, as opposed to they did and bugged it and are watching you right this very moment); and their lines of communication are down and/or being monitored (and there are informants everywhere). It seems stupid, and it is, but it's a forced error: they can disperse and get hunted down one by one, or meet up in a non-hospital and get bombed, or meet up in a hospital.

Its the result of the success of the neoracist movement lead by Ibrahim X. Kendi and others that started at Harvard and is now everywhere, usually under the banner of "DEI".  It is the intellectual foundation of modern antisemitism, just like social Darwinism was the intellectual foundation of antisemitism 100 years ago.

According to the neoracist ideology, there is no such thing as a white person who is not racist - all white people are racist, and can only absolve themselves of their inborn racism by adopting neoracism (i.e., DEI/affirmative action) as a way to atone for it.

According to the neoracist ideology, the world is also divided into ethical, moral persons of color on one side, and immoral, colonist white Europeans on the other side.  Thus it is easy to distinguish "right" from "wrong" in any conflict where the parties at war are different "races", and the conflict in Israel is the prime example: Israelis are (mainly) Jews, so they are considered "white" colonists; the Palestinians are dark-skinned, so they are considered "colored" "natives" being exploited by evil white people.

The neoracist ideology does not permit any examination of any of the actual issues that may divide groups of people (e.g., Israelis and Palestinians) because all of those issues are believed to result from the exploitative aspect inherent in white-skinned persons, and so the solution is to "get rid" of the white "colonists".

It's messed up, but it is everywhere now.  Starting in elementary school white Americans are now taught that they are secretly racist (i.e., prone to commit "microaggressions" because of their inherent racism), and they are indoctrinated into the ideology over the course of childhood until the university hammers it home by making adoption of the ideology a requirement (that is, to espouse views against affirmative action for example, means someone cannot attend Harvard because Harvard rescinds acceptances to anyone who is discovered to have espoused beliefs that are not sanctioned by neoracism).

And now the NYT/NPR/BBC/WaPo newsrooms are full of white people who believe that morality is a function of race, that race is the central organizing principle of humanity, and that they themselves are secretly racist and have to work everyday to overcome their inherent racism, i.e., by bending to accommodate the most extreme neoracist positions without ever questioning them.  That is why these newsrooms literally never report on a battle that Hamas is actually involved in; to do so would require saying that a person of color was engaged in something immoral, and such would be a betrayal of the principles of neoracism.

This is the same hospital that Israel found a Hamas command post beneath several months ago when they first pushed through this area of Gaza.

In this specific case, Israel swept this area, then left to allow Palestinian civilians to return. They don’t have enough troops to completely occupy every single inch of Gaza, and have no interest in doing so anyway. Once they left, a bunch of Hamas fighters that had disguised themselves as civilians and/or fled south with the refugees returned to try and set back up their command and control infrastructure. According to the IDF reports, a staff member at the hospital tipped off the IDF about Hamas trying to sneak back into their command post, and the IDF showed up and captured potentially hundreds of Hamas fighters, killing at least one high-ranking commander that we know of.

Part of that is because the truth mostly lays somewhere in the middle with this situation.

The interesting thing is that this happened because newspapers didn't pretend to be impartial or neutral back in the day. They all had their bias or spin on the news. However, getting information wasn't easy back then. News were transmitted by telegraph to agencies like the associated press(AP), who sold the news to papers. Now, if AP put a liberal spin on the news, they wouldn't be able to sell to conservative paper. So to make more money, AP simply reported the news in a neutral manner and left the spin up to the papers.

Unfortunately, the AP way of reporting the news became revered outside of AP. Journalistic integrity and all that.

When news became easy to get all over the world with modern technology, everyone could write their own news that appear to be neutral except its anything but.

It's a human desire to simplify the nuances into a yes/no - true/false dichotomy.  It makes the world explainable and thus feel controllable.

This really bothers me because I"ve experienced it too. I also vote for Democrats much more often than not, especially in recent years, but it's upsetting to see the reaction to any point of disagreement. The reaction to any criticism of 'green' energy solutions is an example that came to mind quickly. Immediate accusations of 'they're all in the pocket of big oil' is disgusting. Discussing potential downsides and risks of various green energy 'solutions' shouldn't be an invitation for insults and accusations, but it is. I wonder how many 'liberals' even read the research behind the headlines. I strongly suspect the answer to that is 'not many.' Why was a wind farm built beside a sanctuary for endangered birds? Out of all the possible locations, why did anyone believe that was a good idea. Criticism of that sort of stupidity should not be dismissed as 'paid off by big oil.'

I don't think it's just their leadership that thinks destroying Israel is a requisite for victory.

Palestinians are very aware of how much Hamas has screwed them. The fact that you don’t realize that is one of Hamas’s major propaganda successes.

Which is interesting in that ONLY if you zoom in specifically on Israel v Palestinians is Israel not the underdog. It’s a tiny country, surrounded by hostile neighbors, a lone Jewish country in the world vs 59+ Muslim ones,  and a lone Democracy in the region.

That is the reason why the "fake news" accusation we so often hear from the Left directed towards the Right has become meaningless. Their support for Hamas/Gaza/"Palestinians" is based on the fakest info ever. Those people aren't colonized or oppressed or occupied by Israel. They are oppressed by Hamas, and willingly so it seems. They prefer to live in shit conditions, as long as they can keep hating Israel and killing Jews. The only path towards peace at this point is for them to realize that the path of violent islamism leads to ruin and they need to give it up. Only complete military defeat will make them realize this.

I think most people never paid attention in history class because Palestine has been occupied before Israel. They were under control of the ottomans for around 500 years, the only reason there wasn’t as much conflict was because the ottomans shared a similar religion so they definitely respected the language better and I’m sure politically we’re more closely aligned. The whole thing would’ve been avoided if Britain didn’t decide to take this land from ottomans after world war 1

Members and combatants aren’t the same thing. The Geneva convention distinguishes between combatants (like a Hamas fighter) and non-combatant members (like a Hamas janitor or Hamas clerk).

People like you said the IDF lied about Hamas in using civilian infrastructure for military purposes. In the past few days after a surprise operation at Shifa Hospital, they found at least 790 Hamas/PIJ members inside (650 captured +140 killed). The single most significant period of the war, all mainstream news sources reported on it, and you're main concern is that JPost was used for reporting very very simple facts. Over 790 armed terrorists were in a civilian hospital. You need to learn to accept that as fact lmao.

1. You keep stating something as fact.

The only people that may know for sure are the actual people in the hospital. You can bet that the '790 terrorists' is directly from the IDF. In that case, how are you so sure it is true knowing full well that all wars come with war crimes and that it is common for armies to hide truths?

The only surprising part of this is that people didn't expect the left to hold these views.

Adding into that, if you are a white man you are racist. No debate, no nuance, no content of character through your life will prove otherwise to the left. I faced this when I returned to collegiate studies in 2010. And since POC and minorities don't hold the power no matter what they say, do, or act on, it is never deemed racism. I sat in silence through those years during most debates after I asked the professor if my power and privilege as a white male transcended geography to say China. Would I hold more power and privilege over President Xi. "Absolutely" was the answer. I honestly feel there is a strong correlation with this line of reasoning and the right wing rising in 2016. It was such low hanging fruit for them they didn't have to even try to spin it.

Not worldview as much as rationalization.  If your first, knee-jerk emotional reaction to the situation is to support the underdog, then that locks in your opinion.  As you consider those other facts that don’t fit the opinion you now hold, you find ways to excuse them or de-emphasize them so you can maintain your position.  This happens subconsciously and almost instantly.

Just to piggyback on my original comment from literally 5 minutes ago. The thing that I keep thinking about with this is the claim that IDF was tipped off by hospital staff that Hamas were back. If this ends up being the case then I really don’t see any reason why Israel wouldn’t go in as quickly as possible without giving them enough notice to clear out like what had happened the previous time. This amount of arrests is pretty staggering and if even 1/2 end up being Hamas affiliated it’s a really bad look tbh

Reading over your link, it seems the sources are mostly from the IDF. [4] is a confirmation of combat certainly, but it does not make this information objective.

There was an increase in hate crimes against Muslims after 9/11 but even with that increase hate crimes against Jews were still around 5x more common. While more hate crimes against Jews would be expected as a total number just because they are about double the Muslim population it still doesn't account for the entire difference. So even after the deadliest terrorist attack in modern history was carried out by Muslim extremists a Jew in the US was still more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than a Muslim.

Israel lying doesn't make what you said false. In fact Israel also backs Hamas by escorting the delivery of Qatari payroll to Hamas fighters so they won't have to come up with a new reason to kill Palestinians for their land.

I’m well aware of roof knocks, which have completely been abandoned as a tactic since last October, but let me rephrase my original statement. Israel only cares about civilian casualties due to the negative press and erosion of positive public opinion that it brings to them. I’ve seen enough videos and read enough articles over the years of IDF soldiers just blatantly killing Palestinians, including journalists and NGO workers. Very easy to find. It’s a problem, even when they aren’t “at war.” And honestly, there’s no accountability when they do it. Human rights organizations have been bringing attention to this for decades. The US will throw some harsh words their way and that’s the end of it. It’s very rare that anyone gets convicted when IDF soldiers kill civilians and years of doing that is catching up to them finally, at least in the court of public opinion. I’m not saying this because I’m pro-Hamas or feel that Hamas should be given a pass for their own atrocities. I’m saying it because because accountability and fair conduct towards civilians is imperative in war even when the enemy is engaging in terrorism. The dehumanization of Palestinians as a whole is a big problem within the IDF, and very much contributes to their conduct when dealing with Palestinian civilians. They do not care about their lives. Once again, I absolutely believe Hamas is a group of religious fanatics that engage in terrorism, but that’s not a free pass to just mop the floor with innocent people. We need to be honest about these things and recognize the faults and atrocities of all parties involved, even those we may consider to be the “good guys.” I’m very tired of people blowing off blatant war crimes just because their side does it.

In contrast I feel like Israel has really dropped the ball in promoting a point of view that is acceptable to the world at large.  They focused on internal politics and let Hamas take control of the information space around the world.  Simply replying and raging about anti-semitism at every opportunity did them nothing to explain their cause, their perceptions, or to endear themselves to those who would be inclined to sympathy for their position.  They have solid allies who would support them, but frankly Israeli statements, even well justified ones, often come off as arrogant and that is something that drives people to consider their opponents point of view.

Now you can add in some Americans, evangelical, some people elsewhere, but overall there is not a neutral space into which this conflict is extended. It’s a heavily weighted space like the UN having about 56 countries that are Muslim to 1 Jewish. No wonder Israel is the target of 1/2 the resolutions.

Curious, as to what POV you’d point out? What would you do differently from a public relations standpoint? I feel that while the anti-semetism card may be overplayed Israel is at a huge disadvantage regardless of what they do.

It's a generally accepted truth that American (and most western nations with big armies) have contingency plans to invade pretty much anyone, anywhere, just in case.

If people think only military might alone will win a war without a propaganda victory then perhaps people have missed the history of Gandhi's defeat of the British Colonial Empire or multiple other wars that end up with victory on the battlefield and defeat in the long run (Vietnam and Afghanistan 2X's also come to mind).  Israel absolutely needs to start dominating the information space much better than it has.  It seems obvious to an observer that Israel has failed to keep the public opinion worldwide sympathetic to its plight.  It has allowed the Palestinian diaspora to dictate the sympathies and perceptions of people worldwide and thus deteriorate its moral high ground to a thin shelf of ice on a very tall iceberg heading to the tropics.

Its "intentionally blurry" because there are two Palestinian medias that exist: one for consumption by actual Palestinians and the wider Muslim world, and then one for consumption by potential sympathizers in the West. The former is basically wartime propaganda, as Palestinian militias in Gaza and the West Bank openly claim and take credit for combat engagements with the IDF every, single, day; the latter is basically atrocity pornography, and if you were watching only that, you'd be hard-pressed to even garner that Hamas even exists.

The reason there is so much obfuscation and misinformation with the Israel/Palestine war, is that there is no moral high ground. It's a massacre, started by a massacre. It's fucked all around, but Israel and it's allies want to continue, so they have to cloud how horrible what they are doing actually is. That's why you don't see the pics of children pulled from the rubble on a sub like here that is very pro-israel, and that's also why headlines like these are taken at face value and other headlines talking about Israel torturing folks aren't.

Look back at the Nordstream explosion. The other side was arguing that it was clearly the West who did that from the very beginning, but this was heavily suppressed both by the institutional media and also public voices who were largely trained to view all counter narratives as Russian. And this doesn't really need Russian history to see - mostly the comments by Anthony Blinken just prior to the attack (saying it would have been nice if Germany never aggreed to Nordstream, or all of a sudden wasn't reliant on it as Russia used it as a bargaining chip - which he wasn't wrong about).

To take a maybe less charged topic (from a US political discourse standpoint) - the CIA drone strike of that child in Afghanistan while the pull out was occurring. Early on it was painted as retaliation and a successful strike against terrorists associated with the bombing at the airport barriers. Skeptical folks at the time figured this was only part of the story and it appeared to be a potential civilian/collateral damage nightmare. That was later reported - about 3-4 months after the fact and again got kind of sidelined.

One thing that has struck me for a while is the two sides no longer can agree on basic facts of history. They talk right past each other.

This is obviously ahistorical but it doesn’t matter if they believe it. The two sides since then are in an endless regress of “well you did x,” “oh but only because you did y,” “but you did z…”

I was TOLD by a young, white US-based individual who is rabidly pro-Palestinian ✊🏽🤨 that there are NO Middle Eastern Jews in Israel. “There might be a few Ethiopians, but the rest are white…there are no Jews of Middle Eastern descent in Israel….they ALL migrated there from Europe in 1948 & stole everything from the indigenous Palestinians.” - And there are a SHIT TON of people out there who actually believe this.

The first one is structural racism, where the shape of society can favour certain groups over others.  But while it can be enabled by many people making bigoted choices, it can also quite easily involve no one being bigoted, but instead making self-interested choices using skewed incentives.  There is not necessarily any person fault that a person can be called out for.

They don't publish them on the front page, those get stuck in a dedicated little section that I dare you to find on your own without any hints on their website. This is a tactic that propaganda places use all the time to make themselves look more legit. They scream at the top of their lungs things that make their enemies look bad and then when they're called out on it They do as little as possible to retract the statement. For example bearing the retraction in a little subsection of the website nested within multiple pages.

What reason would Israel have to raid a hospital AGAIN at a moment when they are trying to keep the world from fully turning against them? It is absolutely beyond reason and to me that is the place that I end up landing at. They must have had justification for going in, and the fact that they were seemingly fired upon before entering and initiating any fire of their own seems to corroborate that something was up at the hospital. I don’t really know how much good faith you have in making your case here but I’m just trying to approach this from a place of common sense and rationality.

When Jihadi sources are also saying there was combat in the hospital that indicates that there were armed militants in there because nobody else would be putting up a fight.

Que the ceasefire now who are so stupid they can't understand they are calling for a armistice not a ceasefire.

I do see the possibility of a military victory for israel as I don't view it as a afghanistan situation for them. Isreal won't stop if the us just stops supporting them that should be pretty clear by now. They are a highly developed nation with a military industrial complex that punches far above its weight and will just push them towards other less savory allies.

It’s not about opinion or bias it is about the integrity of their sources and whether there is ill-intent behind the information passed on by them and the way it’s presented. I would have to do some digging to find examples of this but the first things I can think of are the Reuters photographers who accompanied Hamas on their 10/7 assault, laughing about the photos they took documenting the murder of Israeli soldiers on a livestream because of the global attention it would bring their cause.

Easy example is npr. They refer to the war as either Israel’s war in Gaza or the Israel offensive. They don’t refer to Hamas as terrorists. Even bbc will caveat that some governments considers Hamas terrorists.  When quoting Hamas, they refer to them as Palestinian officials. They often interview Palestinian experts but leave out the experts associations with Hamas or their clear anti-Israel stance. They frequently report the Palestinian perspective and the few times they bring on Israelis or Jewish people, it’s usually someone against the war.

Sure, I can agree with you there. Of course based off the Palestinian narrative of “proportionality” it very much is a point in comparing the two and explaining how Hamas’ deliberate targeting of civilians, and the widespread horrible atrocities committed might pale into comparison to the gaza invasion. That is ignoring the fact that israel has warned civilians that their building is a target and has entire teams dedicated to calling gazans and giving them orders to evacuate their buildings.

There is a clear difference in the motives and expected outcomes for both sides, one wants to annihilate the other and the second wants to not be annihilated.

True. But this is also an admission that Israel doesn't want peace, and that the average Israeli wants blood and thus also an admission that this *is* intentionally a massacre. Why are condemning Hamas but turning a blind eye or even being apologist to the other half of this equation that don't want peace? Palestinians were no doubt harmed by Hamas actions, but that's indirect harm through some kind of transubstantiation of Israel's direct harm of Palestinians somehow being Hamas fault. The ones killing innocent people are the ones doing the harm. The blame stops there,.it's that simple. If that be Hamas or Israel that fired the bullet or dropped the bomb then they are the actor to blame.

You have to understand that Hamas didnt just carry out an attack like they did in a vacuum, the Palestinian people greatly support such brutality and cheer it on. Does Israel and Israelis want peace? Of course, but how can we have peace when it is obvious that only one side adheres to that notion of working for peace.

{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.68, 'pos': 0.256, 'compound': 0.9204}

Then you have to understand that the israelis don't want peace either. Hamas doesn't launch rockets unprovoked. Israel has been perpetually terrorizing the Palestinians since before Hamas existed. It's been a perpetual back and forth of escalation for decades. Israel isn't innocent, they just have more power.

Also not what I’m saying. I said they still fall into the “local sources” trap not that they are more susceptible to it. What I am saying is literally that the past 18 years of indoctrination in Gaza have taught people that suffering brings attention to their cause so the local journalists who may also be connected to Hamas through family or financial means have a vested interest in telling a story from the perspective that maximizes suffering. This is also what I think happened in the case of the journalist making claims of IDF torturing doctors.

{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}

* Syria: Has been officially at war since 1948, though they haven't done much of anything since they lost most of the Golan heights in 1967.

{'neg': 0.205, 'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7351}
------------

* Lebanon: Technically not at war, however anyone holding an Israeli passport, or any other passport with an Israeli stamp or visa, is barred from entry. They also largely turn a blind eye to the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, which is pretty much the same deal as Hamas, and controls the southern regions which border Israel. They have been firing various munitions towards Israel since Oct. 7th

{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.3063}

* Jordan: Actually at peace, and generally views Israel as an ally. Despite this, they still frequently pay lip service to Palestinian talking points.

{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.4767}

{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.6258}

* Gaza: Not sure I have to explain this one.

{'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2411}
------------

* West Bank: The PA is *nominally* at peace, or at least in a state of ceasefire, though no official peace agreement has ever been signed, so essentially in the same boat as Syria. They cooperate with Israel where it benefits them, but then they also provide the pay-to-slay Martyr's fund.

"Professional" means exactly what it sounds like - that it is a profession. The IDF is a professional army. It's members are full-time and are paid. That mandatory service exists is irrelevant, because *why* you serve has nothing to do with whether or not it is a professional army.

Besides which, you're making it sound as if the entire IDF is composed of conscripts. This is not remotely the case. Mandatory service is only ~3 years. Anyone staying on longer than that is doing so voluntarily, and all NCOs and other officers are volunteers. I would also expect that most actual combat troops, particularly in more elite units that would likely being most of the heavy lifting in Gaza, are going to be volunteers, simply due to the benefits of experience and training.
