kvwtpbs,AviationAdam,"We’re in a groupthink world now. If you subscribe to x ideology you’re expected to follow all the other ideas that come with it. I can’t stand the political parties because I generally vote blue (honestly it’s been straight ticket the last two election cycles) but if I have even one opinion that does not follow the liberal think tank then I will get harassed incessantly for not falling in line. Same thing goes with republicans.

ANYWAYS that’s why this war is so polarizing people have chosen their camps and are going to spin the narrative in the best way possible to fit their worldview. For most people on the left it’s that the IDF is a genocidal war mongering brutalist regime that’s on a mission to kill every Palestinian with dictator like efficiency. Every article you read that leans hard left will support this. There is almost no room for nuance and you’ll be ousted by your own party for saying “wait a minute that doesn’t make sense”.

This is also not me endorsing the IDF I think in many cases they have gone way too far and I do sympathize with the average innocent Palestinian that is struggling to get by. But I can’t stand when people act like certain groups are holier than thou. I overheard the other day an individual saying they understand why Hamas did it and they support them, I just can’t imagine being so anti-IDF that you start supporting one of the worst groups on the planet.",313,1711039502.0,kvwpu9n,2024-03-21 12:45:02

kvx7j8z,crake,"Its the result of the success of the neoracist movement lead by Ibrahim X. Kendi and others that started at Harvard and is now everywhere, usually under the banner of ""DEI"".  It is the intellectual foundation of modern antisemitism, just like social Darwinism was the intellectual foundation of antisemitism 100 years ago.

According to the neoracist ideology, there is no such thing as a white person who is not racist - all white people are racist, and can only absolve themselves of their inborn racism by adopting neoracism (i.e., DEI/affirmative action) as a way to atone for it.

According to the neoracist ideology, the world is also divided into ethical, moral persons of color on one side, and immoral, colonist white Europeans on the other side.  Thus it is easy to distinguish ""right"" from ""wrong"" in any conflict where the parties at war are different ""races"", and the conflict in Israel is the prime example: Israelis are (mainly) Jews, so they are considered ""white"" colonists; the Palestinians are dark-skinned, so they are considered ""colored"" ""natives"" being exploited by evil white people.  

The neoracist ideology does not permit any examination of any of the actual issues that may divide groups of people (e.g., Israelis and Palestinians) because all of those issues are believed to result from the exploitative aspect inherent in white-skinned persons, and so the solution is to ""get rid"" of the white ""colonists"".

It's messed up, but it is everywhere now.  Starting in elementary school white Americans are now taught that they are secretly racist (i.e., prone to commit ""microaggressions"" because of their inherent racism), and they are indoctrinated into the ideology over the course of childhood until the university hammers it home by making adoption of the ideology a requirement (that is, to espouse views against affirmative action for example, means someone cannot attend Harvard because Harvard rescinds acceptances to anyone who is discovered to have espoused beliefs that are not sanctioned by neoracism).

And now the NYT/NPR/BBC/WaPo newsrooms are full of white people who believe that morality is a function of race, that race is the central organizing principle of humanity, and that they themselves are secretly racist and have to work everyday to overcome their inherent racism, i.e., by bending to accommodate the most extreme neoracist positions without ever questioning them.  That is why these newsrooms literally never report on a battle that Hamas is actually involved in; to do so would require saying that a person of color was engaged in something immoral, and such would be a betrayal of the principles of neoracism.",8,1711043964.0,kvwhzwr,2024-03-21 13:59:24

Hamas places their HQs in places like this specifically because they are supposed to be protected by international law, and if Israel attacks them, the media get to publish “ISRAEL ATTACKS HOSPITAL” headlines, furthering Hamas’s cause.

In this specific case, Israel swept this area, then left to allow Palestinian civilians to return. They don’t have enough troops to completely occupy every single inch of Gaza, and have no interest in doing so anyway. Once they left, a bunch of Hamas fighters that had disguised themselves as civilians and/or fled south with the refugees returned to try and set back up their command and control infrastructure. According to the IDF reports, a staff member at the hospital tipped off the IDF about Hamas trying to sneak back into their command post, and the IDF showed up and captured potentially hundreds of Hamas fighters, killing at least one high-ranking commander that we know of.",54,1711054897.0,kvxgpha,2024-03-21 17:01:37

The interesting thing is that this happened because newspapers didn't pretend to be impartial or neutral back in the day. They all had their bias or spin on the news. However, getting information wasn't easy back then. News were transmitted by telegraph to agencies like the associated press(AP), who sold the news to papers. Now, if AP put a liberal spin on the news, they wouldn't be able to sell to conservative paper. So to make more money, AP simply reported the news in a neutral manner and left the spin up to the papers.

Unfortunately, the AP way of reporting the news became revered outside of AP. Journalistic integrity and all that. So the biased newspapers began to emulate the neutral style, while maintaining their biases. When news became easy to get all over the world with modern technology, everyone could write their own news that appear to be neutral except its anything but.",3,1711092292.0,kvy6190,2024-03-22 03:24:52

The single most significant period of the war, all mainstream news sources reported on it, and you're main concern is that JPost was used for reporting very very simple facts. Over 790 armed terrorists were in a civilian hospital. You need to learn to accept that as fact lmao. 

There's a huge difference between a tabloid putting a spin on a random celebrity story  and a ""legitimate"" news source catered to hundred of millions of people deceptively ignoring simple facts that would otherwise undermine their narrative if reported honestly and fairly. If for a fact 790 terrorists were in Shifa, and Arab media reports or frames it as the IDF deliberately targeting civilians only and leaving out the terrorist part, you don't see that as a little problematic?

The only people that may know for sure are the actual people in the hospital. You can bet that the '790 terrorists' is directly from the IDF. In that case, how are you so sure it is true knowing full well that all wars come with war crimes and that it is common for armies to hide truths?

Look both sides of the media are going to put their spin on it. I don't think it is acceptable of course, but I am not naive enough to think everything is black and white nor presented that way by media.    

Based on the above, I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle of the claims. Perhaps the IDF found Hamas in the hospital, but maybe not in the numbers they claim. Perhaps there are a number of civilians, staff, patients.

kvxxuj3,oripash,"Iran’s involvement isn’t in question, but Iran is “the how guy” and navigator, not the bus driver.

Hamas is one of ten violent militia pretending to be liberators that Russia used to create a forever war and a geopolitical bomb they can blow up. It’s less special than we like to think. Six of them are Russia solo, four are joint ventures with Iran. Russia is dividing other countries too - from the US to Israel, from Poland to India - by funding activities that stoke outrage and entrench hate at the extremes - but those haven’t reached armed conflict status yet.

These geopolitical bombs can be blown up once in two decades (to tie up whoever needs to come and restore order) and it’s for the occasion of **Russia’s** elections that the order came down to Hamas to self-destruct, not for the occasion of Iran’s election. 
That alone gives you an idea of whose agenda the Iran-Russia alliance is serving with its most high value resources. 

And before you say “no, they were motivated by a ‘derailing the Israel-Saudi-US normalization and Palestinian concession talks’ agenda” - that too, for sure - but that didn’t drive Russia and Iran ordering its other unrelated geopolitical bombs go off - Houthis and Transnistria - to go off right ahead of Putin’s election ritual.

We need to stop obsessing about the puppet and start talking root causes here. The forever conflict in Gaza is driven first and foremost by Moscow. It’s just that the way they’ve been doing things for half a century ([literally telling us it’s how they do things](https://youtu.be/tR_6dibpDfo?si=tw4oY12tw8APxdwc)) is by acting through an intermediary - such as Hamas or Iran - to conceal their hand.

I am an Israeli, and I understand we’re fighting Hamas well, and that Sinwar is a messed up individual that on the face of it is making organizational self destruction decisions, while butchering his own people. 

But am acutely aware he needs resources - guns, arms, foreign safe haven for leadership, and one “Internet Research Center in St Petersburg” worth of online trolls to flood every sub on Reddit and every Twitter conversation with English speaking Hamas apologists who are all, every single one, trained to express contempt using the words “lol”, “rofl” and “lmao” to disguise themselves as westerners. He needs those resources. 
So when Russia knocks on the door of Transnistria and tell them their play, and when they and Iran knock on the Houthi door and tell them what they’re going to do, rest assured there’s a knock on Sinwar’s door too. And put one and one together… remembering he’s destroying Hamas for them… and you can rest assured when he opened the door and they told him what Hamas’s “fight to the destruction of your command” role will be, they were not asking, they were telling. 

It’s a Russia agenda we’re looking at. Not a Palestinian one (which remained stuck in the negotiations), or even an Iranian one (which is to win the opportunists of the century award, give Russia everything it wants before its capabilities implode, in exchange for things it was never prepared to help Iran get in the past, from jets to nukes).

Israel only cares about civilian casualties due to the negative press and erosion of positive public opinion that it brings to them. I’ve seen enough videos and read enough articles over the years of IDF soldiers just blatantly killing Palestinians, including journalists and NGO workers. Very easy to find. It’s a problem, even when they aren’t “at war.” And honestly, there’s no accountability when they do it. Human rights organizations have been bringing attention to this for decades. The US will throw some harsh words their way and that’s the end of it. It’s very rare that anyone gets convicted when IDF soldiers kill civilians and years of doing that is catching up to them finally, at least in the court of public opinion. I’m not saying this because I’m pro-Hamas or feel that Hamas should be given a pass for their own atrocities. I’m saying it because because accountability and fair conduct towards civilians is imperative in war even when the enemy is engaging in terrorism. The dehumanization of Palestinians as a whole is a big problem within the IDF, and very much contributes to their conduct when dealing with Palestinian civilians. They do not care about their lives. Once again, I absolutely believe Hamas is a group of religious fanatics that engage in terrorism, but that’s not a free pass to just mop the floor with innocent people. We need to be honest about these things and recognize the faults and atrocities of all parties involved, even those we may consider to be the “good guys.” I’m very tired of people blowing off blatant war crimes just because their side does it.

Look back at the Nordstream explosion. The other side was arguing that it was clearly the West who did that from the very beginning, but this was heavily suppressed both by the institutional media and also public voices who were largely trained to view all counter narratives as Russian. And this doesn't really need Russian history to see - mostly the comments by Anthony Blinken just prior to the attack (saying it would have been nice if Germany never aggreed to Nordstream, or all of a sudden wasn't reliant on it as Russia used it as a bargaining chip - which he wasn't wrong about). 

Now - plenty of reporting in the mainstream outlets has been produced to basically link this back to Ukrainian interests for the very clear reasons that many were citing initially. But, it drops 6 months after the fact and mostly goes under the radar. 

To take a maybe less charged topic (from a US political discourse standpoint) - the CIA drone strike of that child in Afghanistan while the pull out was occurring. Early on it was painted as retaliation and a successful strike against terrorists associated with the bombing at the airport barriers. Skeptical folks at the time figured this was only part of the story and it appeared to be a potential civilian/collateral damage nightmare. That was later reported - about 3-4 months after the fact and again got kind of sidelined.

Deliberate killing, yes. But in a situation where the combatant status is in doubt like in this, they are in a very gray area. [Perfidy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy) is also a war crime and a person pretending to be a non-combatant and then opening fire (or similar) will lose their right both to be a POW and to civilian protection and will be shot in sight.

There is also this:

> Article 28

> The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.

> Article 43(2) of Additional Protocol I (AP1) to the Geneva Conventions of 1949

> If there is any doubt as to whether the person benefits from ""combatant"" status, they must be held as a POW until they have faced a ""competent tribunal"" (Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (GC III) to decide the issue.

Geneva Convention also bans using civilians as shields, so at that point the civilians around the combatants will be killed and the debate is whether killing those could have been avoided. However, in such a human shield case the responsibility is on the one using human shields.

3. Get ready to admit you were wrong when the evidence releases. 
4. Like I said, if you think its normal for media to put a ""spin"" by ignoring terrorists were in the hospital, that is very close to pure evil and should be setting off alarm bells for any sane person who recognizes this. 
5. They are terrorists, not defenders. Why the hell do hundreds of armed Jihadis need to protect a fucking hospital dude. That alone makes you a terrorist. The IDF is not targeting civilians deliberately. I suggest you do some research on why people compare Hamas to ISIS. Check out Hamas.com
6. Even if IDF lied about the numbers, you should fully accept Hamas operates within civilian infrastructure for military and PR advantages at the expense of the lives of innocent Gazans.

The first one is structural racism, where the shape of society can favour certain groups over others.

There is not necessarily any person fault that a person can be called out for.

The other is traditionally what is referred to as racism, and is when a person reduces others simply to their skin colour.  People getting called out for this is right and proper, and necessary.

True. But this is also an admission that Israel doesn't want peace, and that the average Israeli wants blood and thus also an admission that this *is* intentionally a massacre. Why are condemning Hamas but turning a blind eye or even being apologist to the other half of this equation that don't want peace? Palestinians were no doubt harmed by Hamas actions, but that's indirect harm through some kind of transubstantiation of Israel's direct harm of Palestinians somehow being Hamas fault.

Are you serious? You accuse me of being ignorant of facts, yet you need me to ""qualify"" what neighours Israel is at war or otherwise in conflict with?

Let's go down the list, shall we, and to keep things simple we'll stick strictly to nations/groups that actually border Israel:

* Syria: Has been officially at war since 1948, though they haven't done much of anything since they lost most of the Golan heights in 1967.
* Lebanon: Technically not at war, however anyone holding an Israeli passport, or any other passport with an Israeli stamp or visa, is barred from entry. They also largely turn a blind eye to the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, which is pretty much the same deal as Hamas, and controls the southern regions which border Israel. They have been firing various munitions towards Israel since Oct. 7th
* Jordan: Actually at peace, and generally views Israel as an ally. Despite this, they still frequently pay lip service to Palestinian talking points.
* Egypt: Pretty much same deal as Jordan, though they seem far less stable, given the relatively recent history of coups.
* Gaza: Not sure I have to explain this one.
* West Bank: The PA is *nominally* at peace, or at least in a state of ceasefire, though no official peace agreement has ever been signed, so essentially in the same boat as Syria. They cooperate with Israel where it benefits them, but then they also provide the pay-to-slay Martyr's fund.

And that's just the official governments. There are like 3-4 different terrorist groups within Palestine that all want Israel eradicated.

>By military checkpoints all over the country, I mean military checkpoints all over the country. Or Israeli border police, maybe you consider them non military.

So... where *precisely* are they located? Is it perhaps at the *border*? Are you telling me your country doesn't have any sort of border control?

>As to my source, I saw everyone in the Palastinian van out in the hot sun, hands on head, one guy taking everything out of the van, already a load of stuff on the road. I saw this with my own eyes, and was waved through. do you accuse me of lying?

Depends, do you consider intentionally using misleading language to elicit a specific response to be lying?

""Dismantling a car"" is not remotely the same thing as ""searching a vehicle"". I'm not going to sit here and pretend that Israeli border police were likely being kind in how they went about this... but it's curious that you still felt the need to make it sound worse.

>You never said they were a conscript army. you said they were a professional army. Like the us army, or the uk army, ie not conscripts. It does indeed proclude them being a professional army. They might ""act"" professionally, but that is a deeper question. So your statement was false.

... No.

I literally JUST said that ""conscript"" and ""professional"" are not opposites. The term you are looking for is ""volunteer army"", which I never used.

""Professional"" means exactly what it sounds like - that it is a profession. The IDF is a professional army. It's members are full-time and are paid. That mandatory service exists is irrelevant, because *why* you serve has nothing to do with whether or not it is a professional army. 

Besides which, you're making it sound as if the entire IDF is composed of conscripts. This is not remotely the case. Mandatory service is only ~3 years. Anyone staying on longer than that is doing so voluntarily, and all NCOs and other officers are volunteers. I would also expect that most actual combat troops, particularly in more elite units that would likely being most of the heavy lifting in Gaza, are going to be volunteers, simply due to the benefits of experience and training.

>I agree, inaccurate to the point of lying is indeed irrelevant to your wider moral claims.
