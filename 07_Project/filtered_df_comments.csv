But after seeing these animalistic Palestinian Muslim Jihadists Terrorist Hamas low lives murder, rape, and torture children, young girls, the elderly, they need to be wiped out. Any Jihadist extremism needs to be eliminated. And Israel needs to enforce stricter policies or a more effective occupation. This is absolutely one of the worst crimes against humanity cases in a developed country, aside from Ukraine. 
We see this conflict in Turkey/Kurds, Russia/Ukraine, USA/Native Americans, China/Taiwan-Uighur, Burma/Rohingya, Hutus/Tutsi. This is nothing new. An apartheid, a one or two state solution that is undeniably impossibly to uphold and implement. These acts of terror and crime are predominantly done by Jihadist Muslims, with the exception of Russia/Ukraine. No side is truly innocent. All sides have reacted in context of self defense. However, this needs to stop. Enough is enough. When will there be enough rape, murder, and corruption? If you support Hamas, you are a terrorist. You are Anti-Semitic. If you support Free Palestine through the persecution and murder of Jews, you are also a terrorist. Crimes against humanity should not take a side or be affiliated politically with one group of people who feel oppressed and need solidarity. Crimes against humanity are simply, crimes against humanity. No matter if you’re Palestinian MuslIm, Israeli Jew, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Burmese, Rohingya, etc. This is not right. We need to stop fighting against each other and leveling ourselves supports of Israel of Palestine. But right now, I support justice. And if Israel needs to defend her land from this terror attack and reclaim their citizens who are being held hostage, I support that because that is an act of justice. Also, the fact that the President of Palestine isn’t reprimanding those horrors tells me all I need to know. He condones evil and violence. Lastly, for those of who don’t know, there is a video on combat footage showing a Palestinian Jihadist father using his infant child as a shield as he yells at him and tells him to walk towards the Israeli soldiers and raise his Palestinian flag. This is evil. It is selfish. That is not justice. I hope you consider the weight of your opinion and outlook. If we keep diving Jews vs Muslim we will always be at war and face discrimination. We need to unite and agree that there are good and innocent Jews and Muslims who do not deserve this. We need to agree as separate groups of people that before we are Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, we are HUMAN. And as humans, let’s come together and support justice.

Israel has had a hold on Gaza and palestinians, treating arabs like second class citizens and so on and so on.

Israel has a large and sophisticated military and and justifies their killing and land grab as part of their fight against terrorism, but make no mistake they have been killing Palestinians and taking their homes and lands since 1948. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, don't have the firepower to go against the Israeli military. Hence, they resolve to rerrorism. 

Neither side is innocent. they're killing civilians, and that has to stop. 

If you look at the Israelis, they're all white. Northern European White. Most of them, at least. 

All relocated from Europe after WWII. Europe didn't want the Jews so instead of ""expelling"" them, they created the state of Israel in Palestine under the pretext that this was their promised land. 

Simply, you have Jews relocating to Israel from all over the world as long as they're Jewish, they can be Israeli citizens. In 1922 there were less than 100,000 Jewish people living in Palestine.

Jews left the area 2500 years ago. 
While they do have a claim in the area, you can not ethnic cleans those who live in the area you're taking over.  

Palestinians, on the other hand, are natives of that land never moved away. 

This land grab has been going on for over 80 years. 
Give Palestine its statehood, and all these senseless wars will stop.
Both sides must coexist there's no power way. 

European powers and USA support Israel because they don't want the Jews in their countries. If they stop supporting Israel, Iran along with some Arab nations will push the Israelis out very quickly. In turn 6million Jews will be back in Europe and USA. And they simply don't want ray.

Absolutely, but that was always true, and the crimes being perpetrated now are no different than the ones that came before, just reversed and packed into a shorter time. Whether you believe it's morally right or wrong, what has been done to the Palestinians for years and decades is a far greater suffering than anything Hamas could ever inflict back in days or weeks, and I think it's important for people to understand that. This did not happen in a vacuum, this did not happen unprovoked, and despite how cruel and/or vicious it is, it's not a *disproportionate* response in its scale (like what tends to happen in the other direction, and likely will in this case too).

My thoughts (preface I’m still working through this so I might mis-type) - I feel as though when I look at Israeli injustice, it’s doesn’t land the same way because of intentionality.

Israel did not build the separation barriers and blockade for no reason, they did so in reaction to fatah and hamas violence respectively. Therefore when I see Palestinians being harmed I know intellectually it is wrong and disproportionate, but my subconscious goes “well, it’s happening due to Israel’s overreaction, not because Israel wants to harm the Palestinians in question”

When I see hamas fighters gang raping, kidnapping, mass executioning etc, the intention IS to harm civilians. Therefore there is a more visceral response. Even though Palestinians have objectively had it worse.

The difference between them is that while the State of Israel cares for it's people, Hamas does not; and this conflict has confirmed me that. Hamas has committed an absolutely insane decision in making this attack, they're committing horrifying crimes against the israeli people, while at the same time dooming the palestinians in Gaza and possibly in the whole world. And that's cause they've never cared about the palestinians more than they care about their fundamentalist islamic ""values.""

I find a lot of the comments here quite disgusting, but I understand why are these things being said. It is this kind of hatred that fuels the treatment of palestines as second citizens, it is this kind of hatred that makes palestine in Gaza electing Hamas, dooming themselves in the process as they'll never be able to free peacifully from the claws of islamic fundamentalism, the same way the german people doomed themselves when they choose the Nazis due to underlying hatred and specially, despair.",3,1696788127.0,172w9gt,2023-10-08 14:02:07

- Palestinians in Israel need to have the same civil rights as the Israelis

- Israel needs to protect its democracy from theocratic authoritarians like Netanjahu 

But also:
- Israel needs to be protected as the only democracy and free country in the region and should always be allowed to protect itself
- Gaza needs to be cleansed of the Hamas so these terrorists don't have their grip and anti Semitic manipulation over the Palestinians anymore
- Palestinians inside And outside Israel need to distance themselves from the crimes of Hamas so maybe maybe one day a two state solution is possible
- surrounding countries like Egypt need to keep working on their anti semitism and recognise Israel as a state

Seen and heard many instances of blood-curdling acts of barbarism from the Palestinian side, beyond that. The one thing that made me far more right wing than any of those, was talking to actual anti-Zionists online.

You need to understand that among the Israeli left, there's a weird assumption that anti-Zionists are their peers and comrades, not their mortal enemies, that can't tell the difference between them and right-wing Israelis. That antisemitism and anti-Zionism are occasionally linked, like among the heads of the Iranian regime or Hamas, or Western Neo-Nazis... but certainly not among educated, liberal Westerners. That those liberal Westerners actually are what they say: mere fighters for human rights, using objective standards, that would protect me and my family, just like it protects the Palestinians. That Zionism is a done deal, and anti-Zionism is the basically the same as left-wing Zionism. Opposing the settlements, supporting a two-state solution, supporting peace.

Hearing how very educated, eloquent actual anti-Zionists talk, made me realize that I was believing in complete nonsense. Even when the anti-Zionists who didn't shoot a single bullet in the back of an old lady's head, or slit a single Jewish child's throat, are tantamount to, say, white supremacists. People who believe in an ideology that's fundamentally not acceptable, and if implemented would lead to horrible atrocities against me and my family.

k41fxsp,ottosjackit,"I agree with most of what you said. However if you replace Israel with the USA and replace Palestine with the Native Americans you can see why the Palestinian argument is a non starter. Right or wrong land is gained through force in many instance’s throughout world history. The USA is a major example. Native American resistance was squashed and a near genocide took place and the result we have today are Indian reservations where they have sovereignty over the land for the most part. If Native Americans and their ancestors were terrorizing people in Chicago for instance they would be rounded up, imprisoned and or murdered. Who would support natives terrorizing modern Americans? The fact is the Palestinians are used as pawns for rest of the Jew and Israel hating populace worldwide. Why wouldn’t Jordan (what a palestininan’s passport would be)accept them rather than using them as a buffer? It’s like if San Diego was recaptured by Mexico and instead of the rest of California taking in the San Diegoans they forced them to become terrorists to gain that land back from Mexico. In this example the US at large would use the people of San Deigo as pawns- human cannon fodder, to have a generations long power struggle with Mexico over a small portion of land. Now of course the US would want to fight to regain the land, however it’s the pushing of the civilians in San Diego to do the dirty work without support that is akin to how the Palestinians are treated. So instead of the rest of CA and the other 49 states accepting refugees from San Diego while they work on a peace strategy, they said you must throw rocks at and antagonize the occupying military as well as suicide bomb and kill as many Mexican civilians as possible who have retaken their land and being resettled by the Mexican government.",2,1696797595.0,k41af52,2023-10-08 16:39:55

What was the end goal or idea for the support?  Did you think if palestine is ""freed"" that they would chill out and go about building their country?  Or possibly would they continue to attack because in their minds their initial actions garnered a good result?

Muslims will never stop as their religion tells them not to. So what are people supporting when they support these muslim causes?  How do they see these conflicts ending eventually?

The only time muslims will chill out is when they are the only ones left on earth. Thats is a fact and dont let a sly sneaky lying imam trick you into thinking otherwise. They are the BEST at lying, weasling and changing meaning when they discuss their cult. 

Israel needs to declare war on the ENTIRE muslim world. 

Tell them- We will hunt you everywhere. Youre leaders are not safe anywhere. We will kill them all when they fly, drive or sleep.

Why is Israel inacting apartheid? 
- Palestinians say it is because Israelies are Zionists who want to control and eliminate them.
- Israel says it is to confine terrorists and ensure safety for their citizens

What do the Israelis want? 
 - Israelis say they want to live in their original homeland without persecution. A democratic state.
- Palestinians say Israelies want to cleanse them from their land and create a Jewish state. 

What do Palestinians want?
- Palestinians say they just want their homes back.
-Israelies say Palestinians want to take over and create a theocratic state devoid of Christians and jews. 


I think there is truth to both sides of these arguments, but the way this attack has gone, it is becoming clear where the true motivations lie.  Israel could have wiped out Palestinians if they wanted to. It would be easy. Israelies are nice enough to call before bombing targets and use precision munitions to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, Palestinians fire rockets indiscriminately and, when given the opportunity, murder and kidnap civilians directly. 

Their constant Allah akbar wails and religious chants drives home the fact that this is not about freedom.. it's about Jihad... about theocratic control. It is not illegal to be Muslim in Israel, that was never their goal.

Just like the argument that the ""Civil War was about states rights"" leads to the rhetorical question ""states rights to do what?""   The argument that ""Hamas fights for freedom of palestinians."" ""Freedom to do what?""

Both sides have delusional religious motivations, but there is a very clear ""lesser of two evils"" here. The veil of the poor downbeaten underdog fighting for freedom has been pulled off.

Hamas are the ones who are willingly offering up Gaza as sacrifice.

They need to be stopped. But they do not represent all Palestinians

Israel also isn’t innocent. They have bullied  Palestine for 75 years. They have done a lot of awful things during that time. They have filled wells that Palestinians used for water with concrete, they have raided mosques for no reason. They have committed war crimes against them. For example: in 2009 Israel used white phosphorus against civilians in Gaza. If you don’t know, white phosphorus is an incendiary munition. When it contacts air, not only does it ignite, but it immediately covers everything in smoke. In addition to the burning it can also cause brain injuries, but it also sticks to skin and clothes. The use of it near civilians is illegal and therefore it is a war crime to use it like Israel did. And now they’re killing Palestinian civilians just like Hamas is doing

Neither side in this is even remotely innocent. Hamas absolutely needs to go, but Israel also needs to cease what they’ve done. Only then can peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis happen

k40zrk4,[deleted],"The history of Israel covers an area of the Southern Levant also known as Canaan, Palestine or the Holy Land, which is the geographical location of the modern states of Israel and Palestine. From a prehistory as part of the critical Levantine corridor, which witnessed waves of early humans out of Africa, to the emergence of Natufian culture c. 10th millennium BCE, the region entered the Bronze Age c. 2,000 BCE with the development of Canaanite civilization, before being vassalized by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were established, entities that were central to the origins of the Jewish and Samaritan peoples as well as the Abrahamic faith tradition.This has given rise to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druzism, Baha'ism, and a variety of other religious movements. Throughout the course of human history, the Land of Israel has come under the sway or control of various polities, and as a result, it has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups.

In the following centuries, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Empires conquered the region. The Ptolemies and the Seleucids vied for control over the region during the Hellenistic period. However, with the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, the local Jewish population maintained independence for a century before being incorporated into the Roman Republic.As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the Land of Israel became the centre for intermittent religious wars between Christian and Muslim armies as part of the Crusades. In the 13th century, the Land of Israel became subject to the Mongol invasions and conquests, though these were locally routed by the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule it remained until the 16th century. The Mamluks were eventually defeated by the Ottoman Empire, and the region became an Ottoman province until the 20th century.

The late 19th century saw the widespread consolidation of a Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism, as part of which aliyah (Jewish return to the Land of Israel from the diaspora) increased. During World War I, the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the Allies led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. The British government publicly committed itself to the creation of a Jewish homeland. Arab nationalism opposed this design, asserting Arab rights over the former Ottoman territories and seeking to prevent Jewish migration. As a result, Arab–Jewish tensions grew in the succeeding decades of British administration.

Israel was never Palestines in the first place. People need to look at history before making assumptions.

k40i6cl,hoyfkd,"No.  And I'll tell you why.  Israel is stepping up their settlement practices, which means forcefully evicting Palestinians from their homes, and moving in Israeli extremists.  They then abuse the Palestinians.

This is NOT condoning what the Palestinian terrorists have done.  But I guarantee that if Mexicans were dragging Texans out of their homes, abusing them, and then ""settling"" their towns, most of the people writing posts like this would be 100% behind those fighting to keep their homes.

Putinyahoo has consolidated the ""Conservative"" powerbase, and promised to *increase* these actions.  Not to mention the insanely undemocratic move of moving towards gimping the courts to protect himself from criminal conviction.  How so many people living in a Democracy are so enamored with criminals is beyond me.  But I digress.

I don't condone attacks on civilians in any conflict, but when one group is literally dragging families out of their homes to move in their own religious extremists, I have a hard time sympathizing with them when they get attacked, especially when it's a democracy.  It's incredibly bizarre to think you can vote in a government that will continually commit abuse a people, and then be shocked when they fight back.  Ultimately, it's the people on both sides, not the powerful, but in a Democracy, the people bear responsibility for their government.

Jewish Israelis only want their home back that was taken from them as there is nowhere else for them to go in the world that is their own and where they are not mistreated and persecuted. The vast majority are fine living side by side with Muslims and Arabs in Israel.

There are over 50 Muslim majority countries in the world yet they fight against Jews having just one Jewish country.

I have never seen Israelis spitting and stomping on Palestinian bodies like is happening now, I have never seen them mass raping Palestinians, I have never seen them kidnapping large numbers of women and children, I have never seen them killing and mutilating large numbers of citizens who have nothing to do with the conflict.

Is Israel perfect? No. But they are not the ones who elected terrorists and support that kind of violence. They are just trying to defend themselves from those terrorists in a very difficult situation. Any time they attempt to attack Hamas, they give warning before they bomb, so they don't hurt citizens. Yet Hamas, elected by Palestinian's, hide among Palestinian's because they know if a citizen gets hurt they can use it to smear the image of Israel. Even in all that twisted propaganda with editing videos capturing IDF and Israel in the worst possible light, I have never seen Israelis commit the atrocities that Hamas and Palestinian's are committing right now to citizens and even random tourists.

And Palestinian propaganda talks about how Palestinian's in Gaza are living in an open air prison yet tons of people go back and forth to work in Israel every day. There are plenty of Arabs with equal Israeli citizenship. It's just that Palestinian's don't want land from Israel they've been offered numerous times, they don't want a two-state solution, they don't want to share, they don't want citizenship, they don't want peace because what they want is to cleanse the land of Jews from the river to the sea.

These terrorist acts happen precisely because pushing back on Palestine for decades makes it so lots of people get radicalized.

I want these things to never happen again, and the only way we're gonna achieve that is by either respecting the Palestine's desire to have their own homeland or genocide. That being the choice I'm very inclined to not genocide palestinians.

The sad thing is this could've been avoided by giving the Palestinians what they wanted in the first place because at this point if you advocate for that people will just say that's ""giving terrorists what they want"" and... yeah? 

But what's the alternative otherwise if not genocide?

Hamas is extreme-fundamentalist and by no means should represent the Palestinian state. However the terroristic nature of a Palestinian Faction does not erase the occupation, structural and direct violence imposed by Israel under the guise of Cultural justification.

The recent event is an atrocity but it has not changed my stance from pro-Palestine. Ultimately, Hamas was conceived as a means of resistance against long term structural violence invoked by the religious rhetoric of Zionism in ""the chosen people's rightful promised land"".

'Chosenness' is a vicious form of Cultural violence as it implies divine entitlement to oppress the 'outgroup' which are in this case, the Palestinians.
This divine entitlement to the promised land has led to killing, deprivation of livelihood from West Bank inhabitants, second class citizenship for non-jews and general exploitation. 

I think it is a necessity not to shift focus from who is using violence to maintain the oppressive iron cage and who is using violence to tear it down.

Having said that, I want to make it extremely clear that I find Hamas' methodologies reprehensible, ugly, cruel and hypocritical. Targeting civilians should never be a tactic of conflict, no exceptions.",-1,1696785944.0,172w9gt,2023-10-08 13:25:44

-2000 years ago and more, Israelites are persecuted and suffer under other nations in the region of modern Israel.

1917 colonist Brits and French started the modern conflict by promising both Palestinians and Israelites the same piece of land in exchange for help against the Ottoman Empire. 
Conflict starts. None of the two countries existed before this. 

1945+ the nations decide in favor of Israelites following WW2 and the Holocaust. 

70 years of wars and conflicts follow, including aggression and invasion from neighbouring Lebanon, Iran, Jordan, Egypt. Israelites push away the Palestinians, the Palestinians don't want to share, the cycle repeats.

Imo, hamas needs to be stopped. Israel has no choice but to bomb targets in gaza (note: they don't bomb innocent people if they can help it), Israel targets specific buildings and knocks first. but hamas has a vast history of bombing civilian territory just for bombings sake.

I'm not saying gaza civilians deserve to live in fear of their house getting knocked on some day, and Israeli sitizens shouldn't live in fear of their house getting hit by rockets. It's a fucked up situation with no foreseeable end.

Imho, the ""stolen land"" argument Palestinians use is as irrelevant now as it was 75 years ago when israelis settled. No one is gonna leave that land, and everyone  wants it all for themselves.

Btw: lots of people say now smth like ""israel gets now a taste of their own medicine"", but it's not true. Israeli citizens are being murdered, innocents.

Palestine is not resisting because Israel has Jews. They are resisting because they have been oppressed and isolated for over seventy years. They have a right to resist. I wouldn’t blame the Native Americans if they tried to burn down the White House.

You can quote statistics of damage on Israel but it is nothing in comparison to the damage Israel has inflicted on Palestine for over seventy years. Palestine has a right to resist. You cannot invade something that was yours to begin with.",-20,1696766702.0,172w9gt,2023-10-08 08:05:02
k3zbmhv,nbtsnake,">resistance is justified when people are occupied

Wrong. This isn't resistance. Unless you think grandmas, children and civilians are the ones ""oppressing"" Palestinians.

>Israel steals their native land

Wrong. Jews bought land from ottomans. Arabs didn't want to share land in the partition and attacked Israel after it had been ratified by the UN. Arabs lost their land when attempting to attack another sovreign nation. They could have used diplomacy and kept their land and possibly gained more but they chose violence instead.

>Muslims and Jews have lived in peace for hundreds of years.

Wrong. It looks like peace to you because Muslims kept Jews and other non Muslims as literal second class citizens. Now they are the masters of their own fate and Muslims can't handle it


>Palestine is not resisting because Israel has Jews

Wrong. It's literally been a core component of Hamas charter that Jews will be cleansed from river to sea. They only changed it recently to ""Zionists"" to not give the game away so obviously.

>Nothing compared to the damage 

Wrong. Israel spends billions in protecting its citizens. Palestinian leaders spend billions in making sure they have nice villas in Qatar and Dubai while wasting money on terror tunnels, cheap shitty rockets and training brainwashed youth to sacrifice their lives so the conflict doesn't end because that's how they keep their lavish lifestyles.

>You cannot invade something that was yours to begin with

Wrong. Arabs only owned at best 11% of land pre mandate. Arab supremacism and racism deluded them into believing it was therefore all Arab land.",15,1696768693.0,k3z8141,2023-10-08 08:38:13

k40fprg,happymoron32,"It's completely possible (and often the case) for multiple parties to be simultaneously understandable, yet wholely condemnable, when it comes to violent actions.

Israel should not be confining those in the Gaza strip to such horrible conditions. The settlements need to not only stop, but be withdrawn from much (if not all) of the West Bank. However, there is clearly a security risk posed to Israelis by those in Gaza. Hamas aren't attacking Israel because of the settlements and they'd just as soon kill every Jewish person if they had the chance to, it's literally part of their creed and the backbone to the foundation of Hamas.

It's understandable why those in Palestine would want to fight back. It's not acceptable to capture, torture, rape, murder and defile the corpses of civilians from Israel, though. Recording yourselves doing it and throwing it into the internet to show off your savagery to the world reveals far more intent than simply ""freedom fighting."" Anyone who says this is ""based"" or ""revolutionary"" is showing their true colors. 80 years ago they would be cheering on Jews being trained off to Auschwitz.

The deaths of Palestinians far outnumber the deaths of Israelis, for a variety of reasons, and it's fair to take that into account when weighing up the responsibilities of both sides to end these struggles. But remember, while Israel might dwarf Palestine on its own, Israel stands against a wave of enemies in the Middle East. If Palestinians stopped fighting, perhaps conditions would grow worse for them, or perhaps not. If Israel stops fighting, it will cease to exist, and all her citizens are likely to face the same treatment you've seen today in videos spammed across Twitter and the news today.

The violence is tragic, none of it should be celebrated, no one should be giddy for vengeance or continuous bloodshed.

We've seen the horribleness of Hamas committing war crimes, because its been lived streamed. Portraits of victims where shown smiling, and humanized given human names and faces. But make no mistake, Israel has already killed more civilians in this latest incident, and that has gone entirely unrelated because no one is parading their names and faces around on the news.

We can condemn both sides for violence, but again, there was always a back and forth with neither side really having its hands clean. Israel having a right to defend herself is not a blank check for warcrimes. At this point, the war resembles not an outright onslaught, but the realities

That said, the one thing I've learned about war, is that total war is a thing, and once both sides have really comitted there is no real right and wrong, just winners and loosers. At this point, dice fall where they may. Neither side really has a moral high ground. Like most of the other conflicts around the globe that we are presented, where the US/West isn't presented as having an interest in, and the victims are names rather than faces.

Dice fall where they may. No one has their hands clean, everyone is pursuing a blood and soil ethnostates.

Hamas, knew what they where doing, which was cause as much shock, outrage, and blood to provoke a response to keep hostilities going that would create more angry bitter hamas supporters. Also derail a Saudi-Israeli peace deal, and make Israel choose from either looking weak, or bloodthirsty.

My position is the same as it was yesterday, is that Israel cannot tell the US it has moral superiority over other states in the region, the west does not need outposts, nor are they are bastion of US/European values and must justify their position in what they do for US, not ""just because we are here"".

Of course the result of this barbaric attack is going to be very bloody for both sides, but your idea that things would get better if we just took “a harder stance” towards all kind of abhorrent behavior sounds laughably simple-minded to me. It sounds like you had no idea what went on in the real world, other than the most saccharine and simple media narratives.

Abuses against civilians generally elicits disgust on the world stage, but the power to intervene is very limited. The world is not a civilized society, like many countries are within themself, where an imperfect but functioning system of justice exists.

On the world stage, it is still “the law of the jungle” that is in effect. This puts a strong limit on how just the interaction between countries can ever be, and it will always be extremely hypocritical. The US for example, has a far better system of society and values to offer to the world, than China or Russia. Yet the amount of abuses that the US is directly responsible for on the world stage, that runs totally contrary to those values, are more numerous than wheat in a field.

I also wonder what those “harder stances” you advocate for actually entails? If you are advocating for more flattening of houses than are strictly necessary from a military standpoint, then are you in any way better than the civilians in Gaza who are cheering for the kidnapped Israelis?

Are kidnapping and rape of women at gun point worse than deliberately dooming innocent children and their families to die horrible deaths by being buried alive? I would actually argue that the latter is worse.",1,1696780243.0,k3zoyfh,2023-10-08 11:50:43

You're not wrong here, I agree. There is systemic racism at play. I'm an American. For the systemic racism in my country we can look to MLK as an ideal minority that white's should see minorities as first, and for blacks to aspire to be like. Now back to Israel, where is the MLK of the Palestinians? Rather than just assuming that Palestinian Arabs and African Americans are identical to each other, let's step back and agree that they are not. They are both fully worthy of equality of rights and respect as are all people, however there is an ideological divide that makes all the difference. The ideology that refuses to compromise and wants to cleanse the land of an ethnic group cannot be tolerated. And I'm not saying that Israel can do no wrong, far from it, Israel is fucked up.

My statement was never about what Israel will or won’t do. It was about those Israelis who for emotional reasons advocate for “flattening“ Gaza.

This is at the one hand understandable in a situation like this, and definitely human nature, but it is also totally repugnant from a moral perspective.

Civilians in Gaza who cheer when they hear about these kidnappings is the same thing. These people also have grievances. Maybe they lost a family member when their house turned to rubble, or maybe they know somebody who did. 

They are fully in the wrong for wishing death or other bad things upon other civilians, or cheering for it, but when people grow to see each other as enemies, this is a common outcome.

k404128,nidarus,">Wow. Equating anti-racist with white supremacists takes some mental gymnastics. Hope you win the misinformation Olympics you're practicing for so hard.

Anti-Zionists are not ""anti-racist"". At most, they're racist against a nation you think deserves racism. The basic anti-Zionist argument, that the Jews don't deserve self-determination in their ancestral homeland, while the Palestinian Arabs do, is racist, not anti-racist.

The same goes for: ""I oppose all forms of ethnic nation-states, I just happen, by a sheer coincidence, to only foam at the mouth about the Jewish one"". That's about as ""anti-racist"" as someone who ""opposes all crime, and exclusively obsesses over crime committed by black people as a matter of sheer coincidence"". But most notably, since anti-Zionists also don't criticize Palestinian nationalism in such harsh terms (even if they do object to it), that argument is most often simply a lie.

>Non-violent anti-Zionists are the only thing that will lead to our collective salvation as Canaanites and indigenous people of the land.

I don't know who ""us"" are, but anti-Zionism's official goal is to remove the right of self-determination of the only Canaanite nation that still exists today, destroy the only state that speaks a Canaanite language as a state language, and convert that tiny sliver of Canaanite culture, to the non-Canaanite Arab identity and language of its neighbors.

The ""indigeneity"" and ""Canaaniteness"" of Anti-Zionists is limited purely to silly speeches, and arguments online. None of them actually changed their name into an indigenous Canaanite name, insisted on switching to a Canaanite language, or tried in any way to revive the culture of any specific Canaanite nation. The only ones who did that, were the Zionists.",2,1696780648.0,k3zoa2y,2023-10-08 11:57:28

Many of the families are refugees, who settled in Sheikh Jarrah after being forcibly displaced around the time of Israel’s establishment as a state in 1948.  Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah have been continuously targeted by Israeli authorities, who use discriminatory laws to systematically dispossess Palestinians of their land and homes for the benefit of Jewish Israelis.  

In response to the demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah, thousands of Palestinians across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) held their own protests in support of the families, and against their shared experience of fragmentation, dispossession, and segregation. These were met with excessive and deadly force by Israeli authorities with thousands injured, arrested and detained.  

The events of May 2021 were emblematic of the oppression which Palestinians have faced every day, for decades.

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, successive governments have created and maintained a system of laws, policies, and practices designed to oppress and dominate Palestinians. This system plays out in different ways across the different areas where Israel exercises control over Palestinians’ rights, but the intent is always the same: to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.

Israeli authorities have done this through four main strategies:

Fragmentation into domains of control

At the heart of the system is keeping Palestinian separated from each other into distinct territorial, legal and administrative domains

Dispossession of land and property

Decades of discriminatory land and property seizures, home demolitions and forced evictions

Segregation and control

If I remember well they were immediately destroyed. Anyways, in 2006 hamas won the elections with 44% of the votes. Afterwards they ousted the plo and took control.

You have to ask yourself how can I defend myself against a neighbour with those intentions, even if I am much more powerful. Wouldn’t you like to know what goes in and out his house, preferably not weapons. Even Egypt acknowledges this and has a tight control on its Gaza border. The blockade of Gaza is a direct consequence of Hamas policy of repeated confrontation with Israel, be it missile launches or terror attacks. The latest operation is also directly related to the recent civil unrest in the strip directed towards the regime. The idea is to deflect from their own mess and root the people against the external enemy.

They’re manipulated to benefit whomever is putting them out. Donald Trump by all the polls in 2016 wasn’t supposed to come close to winning. He did. A small fraction of people from a country isn’t the country itself.

If you don't trust polls, then just say that you have no idea who represents Palestinians best. Don't say it is the PA.

k40fp5i,DopeAFjknotreally,"Dude, I respect that you have empathy for those children, and I respect that you’re willing to civilly discuss this. Let me paint you a scenario and ask what you’d do.

Let’s say your intelligence has identified a terrorist attack that’s going to happen. These men are planning to sneak across the border, raid a village, and kill innocents. You know exactly where these men are hiding. The only way to stop innocent Israelis from dying is to take them out.

The problem is that they’re hiding in an apartment building. So you drop leaflets on the apartment building, alerting civilians that it’s about to be bombed. The civilians choose not to leave. They stand by the terrorists who are planning this attack.

You’re now forced to either let them kill your civilians, or kill them and their civilians.

Which one do you choose?

This is a very realistic scenario that Israelis face all the time. Sometimes, Israelis do bad things too. And when Israelis commit war crimes (and they absolutely have) they should 100% be held accountable.

But the vast majority of the time Israelis kill Palestinian children, it’s a scenario similar to the above.

Aside from the apartheid wall, burning agriculture and all that, there’s no shortage of data indicating Israel’s oppression. Here’s some below but it doesn’t scratch the surface. I’d recommend you look into this yourself:

Members of the Euro-Med Monitor team have documented in this report the killing of 204 Palestinians by Israeli army forces in 2022, 142 of whom were from the West Bank (69.6%), 37 from the Gaza Strip (18.1%), 20 from Jerusalem (9.8%), and five from the Arab localities within Israel (2.4%). It is important to note that this statistic, however, excludes the 18 Palestinians killed inadvertently during Israeli attacks—16 in the Gaza Strip, and two in the West Bank.

With 55 Palestinians killed, Jenin Governorate had the highest number of Palestinian deaths in 2022 compared to other Palestinian cities and governorates, accounting for 26.9% of all deaths. Nablus Governorate followed with 35 deaths, accounting for 17.1% of all deaths; this is due to the higher frequency of Israeli raids and the execution of other special operations in the two governorates.

August 2022 saw the most Palestinians killed in one month, with 42 deaths accounting for 20.5% of the total number of deaths, not including 16 others killed the same month as a result of local rockets falling in the Gaza Strip. The August death toll was high due to the Israeli army’s “Operation Breaking Dawn”, which lasted three days and targeted activists and sites associated with the Islamic Jihad movement in the Gaza Strip. October saw the next highest number of Palestinians killed (28), followed by 23 in April, 20 in November, 18 in September, and 17 in March, all in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

I think the first scenario is better than the second one, but it is also a very unjust and lamentable one.

I wish there were better outcomes available and perhaps there is, but I’m not seeing them.

Israel is fully within their rights to respond militarily to the attacks and kidnappings which took place. I have no issue with that.

What I responded to was your idea that things could have been better if we had just been more strict against extremism. Islamic terrorism is a factor in this conflict, but it is not at the heart of it. It is instead about the interests of the Israelis as a people and a interest of the Palestians as a people. And of the interests of the countries surrounding them.

I’m not someone who tries to brush away the threats and problems of Islamic extremism. I am in favor of severely reducing the amount of immigrants to Europe from Islamic countries, partly because of the many problematic aspects about Islam. But in this conflict, religious extremism is an important factor that influences several things, but it is not the real driver of it.",2,1696783940.0,k407nze,2023-10-08 12:52:20

Why can't the rich Gulf states help the Palestinians? Kuwait expelled 400,000 of them. Moldova a tiny, poor nation took in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, don't tell me Egypt doesn't have the capability to give refuge to Gazans. They don't want to.",1,1696788466.0,k40gy1m,2023-10-08 14:07:46
