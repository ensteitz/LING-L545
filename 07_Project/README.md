# Final Project

For my project, I wanted to merge text encoding and segmentation with data scraped from a social media platform.

## Collecting the data:
To begin, I scraped data from a particular post on Reddit and stored the text in a file named reddit_body.txt.

## Cleaning the data:
Next, using the code from encoding.py, all characters will be uniformally encoded, ensuring that there are no duplicates between similar tokens.

## Segmenting the data:
In this step, the data is segmented: each sentence is returned on a new line for text analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis:
Using VADER, sentiment analysis was performed on the text scraped from the original Reddit post.
