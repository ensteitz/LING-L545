Here's a section of the Hamas "covenant," just to give people some insight into their goals, which is to kill Jews. That's the reason for their existence:

... Moreover, if the links have been distant from each other and if  obstacles, placed by those who are the lackeys of Zionism in the way of  the fighters obstructed the continuation of the struggle, the Islamic  Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no  matter how long that should take.

Their prophet asked his companions to capture women of invaded non Muslims, rape them and the take them as slaves. **When some companions objected he said that doing so would please Allah and so his companions raped those women.** Now following in the Prophet’s footsteps is considered Sunnah and a great virtue. **So Hamas guys are just doing it to please Allah.**

However, when you take the totality of the conflict and its recent (last two years) context, this move by Hamas is not surprising.

I changed my mind. I thought the IDF actually harmed Palestinians and I thought their last behavior was a human rights issue. But after seeing these animalistic Palestinian Muslim Jihadists Terrorist Hamas low lives murder, rape, and torture children, young girls, the elderly, they need to be wiped out. Any Jihadist extremism needs to be eliminated. And Israel needs to enforce stricter policies or a more effective occupation. This is absolutely one of the worst crimes against humanity cases in a developed country, aside from Ukraine.

We see this conflict in Turkey/Kurds, Russia/Ukraine, USA/Native Americans, China/Taiwan-Uighur, Burma/Rohingya, Hutus/Tutsi. This is nothing new. An apartheid, a one or two state solution that is undeniably impossibly to uphold and implement. These acts of terror and crime are predominantly done by Jihadist Muslims, with the exception of Russia/Ukraine. No side is truly innocent. All sides have reacted in context of self defense. However, this needs to stop. Enough is enough. When will there be enough rape, murder, and corruption? If you support Hamas, you are a terrorist. You are Anti-Semitic. If you support Free Palestine through the persecution and murder of Jews, you are also a terrorist. Crimes against humanity should not take a side or be affiliated politically with one group of people who feel oppressed and need solidarity. Crimes against humanity are simply, crimes against humanity. No matter if you’re Palestinian MuslIm, Israeli Jew, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Burmese, Rohingya, etc. This is not right. We need to stop fighting against each other and leveling ourselves supports of Israel of Palestine. But right now, I support justice. And if Israel needs to defend her land from this terror attack and reclaim their citizens who are being held hostage, I support that because that is an act of justice. Also, the fact that the President of Palestine isn’t reprimanding those horrors tells me all I need to know. He condones evil and violence. Lastly, for those of who don’t know, there is a video on combat footage showing a Palestinian Jihadist father using his infant child as a shield as he yells at him and tells him to walk towards the Israeli soldiers and raise his Palestinian flag. This is evil. It is selfish. That is not justice. I hope you consider the weight of your opinion and outlook. If we keep diving Jews vs Muslim we will always be at war and face discrimination. We need to unite and agree that there are good and innocent Jews and Muslims who do not deserve this. We need to agree as separate groups of people that before we are Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, we are HUMAN. And as humans, let’s come together and support justice. Let’s not support the Hamas who parade miser and rape. Support the people who have been killed and those who have been abused by the Hamas.

dude rant all you want and throw in the typical "I support Israel in seeking justice" But the moment Israel bomb or hurt innocent Palestinian civilians they are no different from Hamas. Any person with a clear moral compass would see that. Genocidal dipshits always make one of two claims; if they are Pro-Hamas, they would say they are justified in killings civilians because that's an occupation. If they are pro-Israel, they will argue the same in reverse; Israel is justified in bombing civilian areas because they need to defend their citizens. Truth is simple. Any party that slaughter civilians, pave the ground, or give moral justification for killing innocent people as collateral is the terrorist. Regardless of what side they are advocating for.

As a Mexican who grew up being discriminated against, I want to express my condolences with the Israeli people. I grew up with news footage of white supremacist groups harassing innocent Mexican immigrants who only wanted to provide for their families. Like the Jewish people, we were driven away from what was once ours and returned. Those that were there spat on our face, like in Israel.

Mexico provided food for the first Jewish settlements in Israel so much that the prickly pear cactus is a symbol for both our nations, and it was Jews who advocated for Mexicans' rights in the USA and pushed back against the white supremacist agenda.

Hamas won't go away via violence unless the region is genocided. That's simply how fundamentalist religious groups work. Look at the USA and our middle-eastern interventions.

What Hamas is doing to innocent people is wrong but to use this as a justification that all Palestinians are bad and deserve the wrath of Israel is equally wrong.

Not really. I've always supported Israel's plight for their tiny nation. The maps that were drawn up were dogshit in the first place. Palestine while I do sympathize with their nation building desire they lack the diplomatic tact required to actually bring it about. Militarily they suck. If you lose more than one conflict for your independence you have to stay on the peaceful path if you want to build your own country. Especially if your only military "strategy" is to indescribably bomb civilian infrastructure. Just look at the Ukrainian struggle the missiles they use are used exclusively to target military targets. Tit for tat. But Russia responds by shooting at apartment blocks. That is not tit for tat.

Without looking it up I would say all or most of Jewish Israel is not white European, maybe 50/50 euro to MENA descendant , to the extent that when you picture a “typical Israeli” most people don’t visualize a fair skinned person.. not to mention all the Arab Israelis - around 20% of the population. idk weird quantifying factor . (Quick google search turned up this : Those of European and American ancestry make up about 2.2 million (36%) of the Jewish population in Israel, while Africans fill out another 14.5% and Asians are 11.2%. )And there may have been fewer than 100k Jews in 1922 but there have been Jews that lived there consistently in the 1600-1800’s albeit as a minority group . In 1948, 35% of the Jewish population was native born.

Sadly, it's always been like this, and people simply deny or justify it. If Hamas had the power of Israel, Israel would not exist. Israel has the power to do what Hamas is doing, and it doesn't. That's always been a huge difference that some people are blind to. I'm sure there will be cruelty towards Palestinians as a result of this war, but in general Israel has always done things like warn Gaza before a strike, ask civilians to take shelter, etc. Hamas goes out of its way to use citizens as human shields, and instigate attacks for their own propaganda.

I'm largely of the same opinion. Israel isn't clean in this conflict and they've done many things to justify the anger of the Palestinians, but not at this level of barbarism. As much as I want to advocate peace and restraint, I just don't see how us moderates can realistically ask for restraint from Israel after this.

Nope. Not going to get into what's justified or not, but this shouldn't be unexpected. People can only be pushed so far before they push back however they can, and I have yet to see any civil war or other similar conflict between people rather than armies that didn't look pretty much exactly like this. Is it unfortunate that civilians are dying? Absolutely, but that was always true, and the crimes being perpetrated now are no different than the ones that came before, just reversed and packed into a shorter time. Whether you believe it's morally right or wrong, what has been done to the Palestinians for years and decades is a far greater suffering than anything Hamas could ever inflict back in days or weeks, and I think it's important for people to understand that. This did not happen in a vacuum, this did not happen unprovoked, and despite how cruel and/or vicious it is, it's not a *disproportionate* response in its scale (like what tends to happen in the other direction, and likely will in this case too). I just hope this incident galvanises enough of the right people to bring them to the table and actually deliver positive, meaningful resolution to a conflict that has stagnated and become more hopeless than ever, but I'm not holding my breath. Far more likely is a continuation of the cycle of violence, oppression, and retribution that has persisted since the beginning.

Israel did not build the separation barriers and blockade for no reason, they did so in reaction to fatah and hamas violence respectively.

That being said, I find it so hard to understand why yesterday changed your perspective; I guess it can be chalked up to echo chambers? All sides have been open with their intentions for a long time.

There is a difference between accidental collateral damage from organized military operations (attempting to prevent days like today) and a personal and methodical murder spree.

I knew from an early age that wandering into the wrong neighboring city would have meant my death, my torture, and would likely end with my lifeless body being dragged through the streets by a cheering mob. My teenage hangouts, my city buses, were bombed by deranged people who strapped bombs to their chests. People in my life were murdered - driving on the highway, eating pizza, or just sleeping in their homes. This has happened many times before, just not on this scale. No matter what led to this cultural reality in places like Gaza, there are organized groups of monsters inside who laugh and cheer at human atrocities and raise their children to do the same. Supporting their cause in theory makes you an empathetic person; supporting it in practice makes you a monster.

Not really, I've condemned before the actions of both the State of Israel (but not it's people), and the terrorist organization of Hamas (but not the palestinian people). Both have been key actors (along with external ones, like Iran, the puppet masters of Hamas; or the U.S. or so many other entities) in perpetuating this cycle of hatred, where each side's atrocity tries to justify itself by the atrocity that did the other side x time ago, where we end in a chicken or egg's situation.

The difference between them is that while the State of Israel cares for it's people, Hamas does not; and this conflict has confirmed me that. Hamas has committed an absolutely insane decision in making this attack, they're committing horrifying crimes against the israeli people, while at the same time dooming the palestinians in Gaza and possibly in the whole world. And that's cause they've never cared about the palestinians more than they care about their fundamentalist islamic "values."

It is this kind of hatred that fuels the treatment of palestines as second citizens, it is this kind of hatred that makes palestine in Gaza electing Hamas, dooming themselves in the process as they'll never be able to free peacifully from the claws of islamic fundamentalism, the same way the german people doomed themselves when they choose the Nazis due to underlying hatred and specially, despair.

You need to understand that among the Israeli left, there's a weird assumption that anti-Zionists are their peers and comrades, not their mortal enemies, that can't tell the difference between them and right-wing Israelis. That antisemitism and anti-Zionism are occasionally linked, like among the heads of the Iranian regime or Hamas, or Western Neo-Nazis... but certainly not among educated, liberal Westerners. That those liberal Westerners actually are what they say: mere fighters for human rights, using objective standards, that would protect me and my family, just like it protects the Palestinians. That Zionism is a done deal, and anti-Zionism is the basically the same as left-wing Zionism. Opposing the settlements, supporting a two-state solution, supporting peace.

Hearing how very educated, eloquent actual anti-Zionists talk, made me realize that I was believing in complete nonsense. Even when the anti-Zionists who didn't shoot a single bullet in the back of an old lady's head, or slit a single Jewish child's throat, are tantamount to, say, white supremacists. People who believe in an ideology that's fundamentally not acceptable, and if implemented would lead to horrible atrocities against me and my family.

The only real nuance here, is that some people who call themselves anti-Zionists were merely mislead about what anti-Zionism means (and are actually liberal Zionists or non-Zionists), and some anti-Zionists can put their horrible ideology aside, and concentrate on more rational goals.

But given the videos I’ve seen of what Hamas has done over the last weekend; I don’t think there can ever be peace or the two people can live together.   From a pragmatic viewpoint, in order for Israel to have security for its people; Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza and be allowed to seek refugee in other countries.   Israel should give aid money for relocation for those who leave willingly.  But otherwise, Israel is justified by clearing out people by force.

Edit: in response to the ‘ethnic cleansing’ reply.

For a moment, take into account all the events that led to this current conflict. What were you expecting to happen? For Palestine to play some form of perfect victim and remain oppressed in an open air prison with no real support or change occurring? Palestine and the PLO have been, for 30 years, wanting to uphold an agreement for a sovereign state and recognizing Israel. All Israel had to do was back off their military expansion and the increasing amount of settlements into illegally occupied lands—a statement that’s ironic, since everything has been illegally occupied to begin with—and yet Israel has done nothing of the kind, the opposite in fact! People of any nation have a right to resist and retaliate their oppressors, something universally agreed on.

Thing is, the situation is so bad today that sadly both sides are committing terrible things. Hamas does terrorists stuff, yes, and we should never accept terrorism. However, it went to the point that in the Gaza Strip, they don't have anything left than violence to get anything changed.

I guess most people's opinion about that war is a part of their main narrow agenda. As a resault, they will never choose a side objectively. That's why western progressive people will automaticaly support palastine even without knowing any single fact about the middle east. Even if ironically, as westerns, they might find their selves murdered of raped in Gazza only for being westerns or gays. I know middle east history and indeed understand the roots of the conflict well, but what makes me support Israel is the fact that it shares same philosophical values with the west but still suffer from nonsence antagonism just for being a jewish state. The roots of this antagonism are indeed good old antisemitism, otherwise, any other western a like culture which promotes science and literacy in the middle east was automaticaly supported by the west while religious fundamentalism being rejeceted.

There is no justifying terrorism, and there is no justifying the oppression that creates terrorists. There is no morality here. But you can observe the simple fact that this was a deterministic outcome. You lock millions in an open air prison, in extreme poverty. There is no future in Gaza, and you aren't allowed to get out of Gaza. You have a couple generations now of people who have grown up with no hope, nothing to lose, and who blame you for it. That has exactly one outcome, and we are seeing it play out. If you treat humans like animals, they will remind you that we are animals.

Looking into the history it seems like literally 1000s of years of back-and-forth. What shocked me a lot was the realization how Jews fled Germany during WW II and the cynical words of the Nazis. In fact Mohammed Amin al-Husseini who collaborated with the Nazis has also been mentor to Jassir Arafat the founder of the PLO and he is still today held in high regard. I think the devil is in the details also if you look how the population numbers on both sides developed over the 20th century in the area.

Apart from that on a societal level things like child marriages and arranged marriages seem a little widespread.

I agree with most of what you said. However if you replace Israel with the USA and replace Palestine with the Native Americans you can see why the Palestinian argument is a non starter. Right or wrong land is gained through force in many instance’s throughout world history. The USA is a major example. Native American resistance was squashed and a near genocide took place and the result we have today are Indian reservations where they have sovereignty over the land for the most part. If Native Americans and their ancestors were terrorizing people in Chicago for instance they would be rounded up, imprisoned and or murdered. Who would support natives terrorizing modern Americans? The fact is the Palestinians are used as pawns for rest of the Jew and Israel hating populace worldwide. Why wouldn’t Jordan (what a palestininan’s passport would be)accept them rather than using them as a buffer? It’s like if San Diego was recaptured by Mexico and instead of the rest of California taking in the San Diegoans they forced them to become terrorists to gain that land back from Mexico. In this example the US at large would use the people of San Deigo as pawns- human cannon fodder, to have a generations long power struggle with Mexico over a small portion of land. Now of course the US would want to fight to regain the land, however it’s the pushing of the civilians in San Diego to do the dirty work without support that is akin to how the Palestinians are treated. So instead of the rest of CA and the other 49 states accepting refugees from San Diego while they work on a peace strategy, they said you must throw rocks at and antagonize the occupying military as well as suicide bomb and kill as many Mexican civilians as possible who have retaken their land and being resettled by the Mexican government.

People are angry about the manner in which Hamas proceeded to terrorize Israel and scare the entire Western world over the last few days, which is very understandable and justified.  Though I also agree with you that it would be disingenuous to look at this act in isolation from everything that happened before.

Call me crazy but I think Russia is involved in this somehow. They will do anything to destabilize the West and distract from their own war. It wouldn't surprise me if they helped via misinformation campaigns, possibly arms supply to accelerate, maybe instigate this escalation.  As heartless as it may make me sound right now, the Israel-Palestine conflict is less important than the Russia conflict as Russia remains the biggest threat to world peace. Without getting rid of the current government and their ideologies and values, I don't see any peace and prosperity in the Middle East, in Ukraine, in Africa and even Europe and the US will continue to shift to the right with unimaginable consequences.

I think there is truth to both sides of these arguments, but the way this attack has gone, it is becoming clear where the true motivations lie.  Israel could have wiped out Palestinians if they wanted to. It would be easy. Israelies are nice enough to call before bombing targets and use precision munitions to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, Palestinians fire rockets indiscriminately and, when given the opportunity, murder and kidnap civilians directly.

For each of your questions, I think both answers are correct. Neither the Israelis nor Palestinians are monolithic groups in which everyone wants the same thing. Each side consists of multiple factions, some of which are more moderate, some of which are more extreme.

The biggest issue is that to step away from fundamentalism under Hamas or imprisonment by Israeli forces in thr Gaza area, the Palestinians need to accept Israeli citizenship.  Becoming Israeli Muslim citizens and separate themselves from the conflict.  They need to, as individuals,  show they have more in common as members of Israel than with the evils that Hamas and their bankers (iran). Individual families need to choose to back what is best for them. Live as Israeli citizens (which has been offered and they technically are) or die as associates of Hamas and the corrupted views of Islam they use to control Palestinians.

Please do keep in mind that Israel has been targeting hospitals, including children's hospitals, for years. In 2022, they bombed a children's hospital with F-35s firing the most accurate munitions known to man. This was not a mistake, this was not a missed target. In 2020, the IDF mutilated the bodies of several unarmed civilians they killed.

israel has never and will never purposely murder civilians.

Israël existed before Palestine, like 4000 years before, Jews were building temples and living peacefully. They eventually got attacked by Romans and later by Arabs and were kicked out of their land.

The land of  Judea  is the original name, Israel is the name of the modern state. There weren't just Jews in that area and many gods had been worshipped there not just the Jewish one. Israelis and Palestinians are genetically related they are semetic people one group has European admixtures the other has Arab admixtures so Palestinians have always been in the area they just interbred with different people and converted to Islam. Alot of that history you're sharing seems to be rooted in religious historical points of view instead of actual historical evidence and studies.

Not at all.  Palestinians are desperate they don't have the funds weapons, an army or anything really to fight back.  They are desperate.  Without irony the fight is David Vs Goliath.  Israel has oppressed them for decades. If any other nation commited to the war crimes, apartheid and breaking international law like Israel has done from decades would be stopped by international forces.  They have power and influence in other governments.  The Palestinian people have been abandoned by the world.  Settlers in international law are not considered civilians and attacking them is not a war crime.  I understand that desecrating the dead is inhumane, but under the circumstances of the treatment of Palestinians over the last hundred years a doubt I would act differently.  Every Palestinian likely knows numerous family members that have been treated inhumanly by the Israeli state.

After the 1947 UN backed partition plan of the British Mandate for Palestine, Arab Nations immediately declared war on Israel with the intend on seizing all of the newly formed Jewish State and the absolute rejection of the UN Partition Plan. One can argue that the lack of Arab consultation during the Partition Plan lead to its ultimate rejection among Arabs. Understand two things, firstly, the UK (which administered the Mandate for British Palestine prior to the 1947 Partition) was in a terrible economic and social condition from WW2 and thus eager to rid itself of the responsibility of administering what was rapidly turning into a warzone, and secondly Zionist movements were arguably more political organized and thus were able to advocate better for themselves at the UN, which are the time was mostly a European-dominated entity. These two aspects greatly reduced Arab, or non-jewish consultation during Partition Talks. I believe that this is one of reasons why Arab Nations, and the Arabs within partitioned Palestine/Israel decided to invade in 1947/1948. Again, the British had to decolonize their former holdings and just left, with all of their military (which were holding the peace) after the partition was finalized.

There are radical sects of both Arab/Palestine Nationalist groups and Zionist Nationalist groups. If you want a two state solution than these extremist/terrorist groups need to be dissolved or less the cycle of violence will just continue. These extremist political groups are the main barrier to a two state solution, there have been documented examples of extremist groups from both sides sabotaging peace talks. Radical sects like Hamas are the enemy of normalization, just as some far right zionist groups are. I have never seen this conflict as black and white, there are bad actors on both sides.

Yesterday was awful, truly awful. I fully expect the IDF to invade Gaza and systematically root out Hamas. I think it is warranted as Hamas is the elected political party in Gaza. I am not sure what Israel will do with the inhabitants of Gaza, there are 2 million people there. Maybe it will be administered similarly to how the West Bank is. I think this will lead to a walking back of normalization of relations between other Middle Eastern Countries and Israel. Depending on the US's involvement, this could lead to another 1973 energy crisis. Though I am not sure how likely that is, but it is possible.

I think as time goes on, it becomes less and less likely of a two state solution. I think it is the best solution still. Hamas does not represent the collective Palestinian opinion, it is a fringe extremist group. I do think it is inevitable that Palestinians (especially in Gaza) will radicalize and the cycle will continue unless something changes. However, is compromise something that people are interested in, I am talking from both sides. I don't think so.

Israel also isn’t innocent. They have bullied  Palestine for 75 years. They have done a lot of awful things during that time. They have filled wells that Palestinians used for water with concrete, they have raided mosques for no reason. They have committed war crimes against them. For example: in 2009 Israel used white phosphorus against civilians in Gaza. If you don’t know, white phosphorus is an incendiary munition. When it contacts air, not only does it ignite, but it immediately covers everything in smoke. In addition to the burning it can also cause brain injuries, but it also sticks to skin and clothes. The use of it near civilians is illegal and therefore it is a war crime to use it like Israel did. And now they’re killing Palestinian civilians just like Hamas is doing

The history of Israel covers an area of the Southern Levant also known as Canaan, Palestine or the Holy Land, which is the geographical location of the modern states of Israel and Palestine. From a prehistory as part of the critical Levantine corridor, which witnessed waves of early humans out of Africa, to the emergence of Natufian culture c. 10th millennium BCE, the region entered the Bronze Age c. 2,000 BCE with the development of Canaanite civilization, before being vassalized by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were established, entities that were central to the origins of the Jewish and Samaritan peoples as well as the Abrahamic faith tradition.This has given rise to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druzism, Baha'ism, and a variety of other religious movements. Throughout the course of human history, the Land of Israel has come under the sway or control of various polities, and as a result, it has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups.

In the following centuries, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Empires conquered the region. The Ptolemies and the Seleucids vied for control over the region during the Hellenistic period. However, with the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, the local Jewish population maintained independence for a century before being incorporated into the Roman Republic.As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the Land of Israel became the centre for intermittent religious wars between Christian and Muslim armies as part of the Crusades. In the 13th century, the Land of Israel became subject to the Mongol invasions and conquests, though these were locally routed by the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule it remained until the 16th century. The Mamluks were eventually defeated by the Ottoman Empire, and the region became an Ottoman province until the 20th century.

The late 19th century saw the widespread consolidation of a Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism, as part of which aliyah (Jewish return to the Land of Israel from the diaspora) increased. During World War I, the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the Allies led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. The British government publicly committed itself to the creation of a Jewish homeland. Arab nationalism opposed this design, asserting Arab rights over the former Ottoman territories and seeking to prevent Jewish migration. As a result, Arab–Jewish tensions grew in the succeeding decades of British administration.

Ask yourself, why do Western media and all Western political members say the same thing "Israel have the absolute right to defend itself".  The question that this completely shuts down, the topic of conversation this eliminates is this "Why does Israel have to defend itself"   If you think it is reasonable and fair to imprison a civilian population approx 2.5 million in a tiny strip of land, prevent anyone from leaving or entering, no water, no electricity, no GDP, mass employment.  What do you. Think the people of Gaza would feel?  And then they continue to break the agreement, and encroach on Palestinian land and build illegal settlements.

Hamas launches missiles from heavily populated areas for a reason. Because when Israel attacks back, and targets these launchers, civilians are caught in the crossfire and Hamas/Palestine gains worldwide PR points. It's a well documented tactic by Hamas.

You're absolutely wrong. That land IS their native land. Israel was created in 1948. That land was annexed from Palestine and given to Eastern European refugees by NATO. The US is the only reason they are there. The Israelis abuse those Palestinian people and those Palestinian people have every right to fight for THEIR home. Don't be fooled by the propaganda of the NATO powers. This is exactly the same shit that's happening in Ukraine and Taiwan.

I disagree, Palestinians have been being killed and slaughtered and shot and murdered for the past couple decades by Israeli soldiers, you think if Jews in WW2 got AK47's and bombs they would try and fight humanely? Fck all that, I support terrorizing the Zionists into rethinking their life choices, war is not pretty, we are not doing this for fun, we have suffered too long, this is only the beginning imo and I totally support it. You think a Palestinian soldier who had his father or brother shot and killed by the Israeli military for absolutely no reason is not going to decapitate and spit on an Israeli militant he just shot? Tbh you are delusional if you think after everything Palestinians went through that we are going to handle war humanely, we are gonna handle it the same way Ukrainians are handling Russians invading their land, brutally and mercilessly. Plus in the Bible says that on of the biggest signs of the end of the world is the Palestinian Israeli conflict and in the Quran it says that one of the very last signs of the end of the world is when Palestinians win the war, so regardless of how we do it, we will eventually win, even if we lose 75% of our population from getting massacred by Israelis in the process.

Israel has been on a land grab since the 40's. They want the land the Palestinians have because it's much better. So they justify stealing from them with the idea that they're somehow religiously, or morally owed that land. And how does a population fight against an adversary that has a much bigger, and better equipped military? With terrorism, because it's their only defense. And is it terrorism when they're fighting back? Not to me. I'm no fan of Islam, or religion of any sort for that matter. But I am a fan of live and let live.

Not a single bit. We've been telling Israel this is what will happen if they continue their oppressive and sadistic tactics of imprisoning 2 million people baselessly, and they never listened. We told Israel demolishing homes in Jerusalem to build a dumb park is inhumane and will lead to further injustice, and they never listened. This was all avoidable, Israel never wanted to avoid it and establish a singular fair and equal democracy for all indigenous residents, and this is the outcome. No justice = no peace.

For the innocent civilians dying in Gaza, do you know why they are dying by Israeli attacks?

Is Israel perfect? No. But they are not the ones who elected terrorists and support that kind of violence. They are just trying to defend themselves from those terrorists in a very difficult situation. Any time they attempt to attack Hamas, they give warning before they bomb, so they don't hurt citizens. Yet Hamas, elected by Palestinian's, hide among Palestinian's because they know if a citizen gets hurt they can use it to smear the image of Israel. Even in all that twisted propaganda with editing videos capturing IDF and Israel in the worst possible light, I have never seen Israelis commit the atrocities that Hamas and Palestinian's are committing right now to citizens and even random tourists.

“THERE were two “Reigns of Terror,” if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the “horrors” of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror—that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.”

Absolutely! The problem is that the way Israel treats Palestine, you breed terrorism.  I really hate what happens there on both sides, but IMO it's on Israel (the state, the leadership, the media, not just any and all people just living there) to have caused this situation. What HAMAS did just justifies the Israeli government in coming down even harder on the common Palestinian.

Nope. I still strongly believe both countries are 100% in the wrong. No one should be trying to kill anyone else for thousands of years. If they can't stop acting like kindergartners, it's time to take away what they can't share. 🤷🏼 sorry, not sorry. If we can't stop killing each other over various holy lands, the area should not be inhabited. It should be controlled by a neutral party with no biases (perhaps the Catholics, as much was I hate them, would be useful here. The pope already has a standing army) that allows both parties to visit their sacred land. But no one should live there. Not if this is what will keep happening.

Hamas isn’t Palestine. I think that’s the biggest mistake people are making when it comes to this conflict. It’s an extremist group funded by Iran. The PA and FIDA in the West Bank are Palestine. Hamas has no affiliation with the PA and FIDA. We need to separate Palestine and Hamas when we talk about this conflict. I think the PA should work with Israel to take out Hamas and Israel should completely withdraw from the West Bank and work together with the PA and parties in Palestine that support the two state system along with the UK and UN to help Palestine develop a functional and stable government. The UK and UN created this problem and they should be held responsible for fixing it.

I think this is naive. To change your mind in a single day as if you haven't seen the atrocities committed by IDF for years? Do you not understand the hell that war & violence creates? It breeds hate and a need for revenge. When there are atrocities committed against one party we should expect a retaliation of atrocities. Even fighting back to simply defend oneself in a war requires extreme violence, and everyone doesn't have the same level of honor.

Would check that all those videos were actually from today as there have been many videos posted as being recent but are months or years old. The warfare that is going on in Palestine is what is known as asymmetric warfare. The Palestinians can't go toe to toe with the IDF with any hope of winning; so like resistance fighters in France during WW2 the fighters engage in unconventional warfare. Like the French in WW2 the occupiers labelled the fighters as terrorists and target civilian areas for punishment for any attacks, normally resulting in 10 times the number of civilian casualties caused by the IDF than were caused to Israeli citizens.

No. I won't let one conflict change my opinion of something that has been going on this long. In brief: I still say that the rich neighbors of the Palestinians could have given them a place long ago, but they chose to keep them refugees in their own country in order to keep a conflict against the Jews.

This is so misguided. Hamas and the civilians of Palestine are not the same. Are there terrorists in power right now? Yes. Are the innocent Palestinian people to blame? No. Fuck hamas and all other terrorist organizations. They are making things worse, but that's their MO. The people of Palestine still deserve to be treated as human beings. Do you honestly think shooting down residential buildings is going to bring back the dead? This war has ALWAYS been asymmetrical in Israel's favor.

Has anyone called out the Hamas for this, though? Are the civilians of Palestine opposing the Hamas in any way, ever? Last time I checked, people were celebrating those barbaric acts, in Gaza, in the West Bank, and in big cities in Western countries. Europe has sent billions of dollars in aid to Palestine over the last decades, worked with organizations on the ground, has taken in refugees from the region, has invested in infrastructure and education and exchange programs. What have they made of all this support until now..? And if the civilians of Palestine are not and don't want to be Hamas, then why haven't we heard ANYBODY on their side condemn what happened? I'm with OP, I have always been critical of Israel (and of course all those points of criticism are still valid), but what I have seen yesterday makes me think the Palestinian population is responsible for their fate to a certain degree, and if this is their idea of what's morally right, then they just lost me as an alley.

It won't help save the lives of Israelis, quite the opposite, it will make people more angry and they'll want to join hammas and harm Israel. It doesn't make any sense, think about it. we are taking down buildings with ammo storage or other military purpos. If hammas using residential buildings for that purpose, it's hammas fault! And by the way, in those cases, idf calls to evacuate the building and lunch a warning missile on it roof to warn the people who are in the building and a few minutes after that the army sends the real missile to destroy it. In this logic idf actually cares about innocent Palestinians more than hammas that use them as humans shieldes.

If Native Americans came to your house with the intent of burning it down and raping your wife and daughters, I hope for their sake you'd defend them with deadly force.  Or maybe you'd just give the Native Americans a hug and let them have at it.  Probably the latter.  The Arabs were colonizers and occupiers as well.  They are just mad that Israel has kicked their ass around.  That's how you get to live in a free, peaceful country: you have to be able to kick the sh!t out of others who do not want you to live that reality.

Israel should not be confining those in the Gaza strip to such horrible conditions. The settlements need to not only stop, but be withdrawn from much (if not all) of the West Bank. However, there is clearly a security risk posed to Israelis by those in Gaza. Hamas aren't attacking Israel because of the settlements and they'd just as soon kill every Jewish person if they had the chance to, it's literally part of their creed and the backbone to the foundation of Hamas.

It's understandable why those in Palestine would want to fight back. It's not acceptable to capture, torture, rape, murder and defile the corpses of civilians from Israel, though. Recording yourselves doing it and throwing it into the internet to show off your savagery to the world reveals far more intent than simply "freedom fighting." Anyone who says this is "based" or "revolutionary" is showing their true colors. 80 years ago they would be cheering on Jews being trained off to Auschwitz.

The deaths of Palestinians far outnumber the deaths of Israelis, for a variety of reasons, and it's fair to take that into account when weighing up the responsibilities of both sides to end these struggles. But remember, while Israel might dwarf Palestine on its own, Israel stands against a wave of enemies in the Middle East. If Palestinians stopped fighting, perhaps conditions would grow worse for them, or perhaps not. If Israel stops fighting, it will cease to exist, and all her citizens are likely to face the same treatment you've seen today in videos spammed across Twitter and the news today.

Not really.  I don’t think Hamas represents the Palestinian people in an important way other than being an outspoken terrorist group that vaguely represents the Palestinian desire for independence.

You're just falling to propaganda if you see them trampling on corpses and change your mind. Perhaps it was also propaganda of dead Palestinian children that made you support them o begin with. What a weak outlook. Instead of looking at outcomes from the cycle of violence, find who started it and who is propagating it to begin with. It all started with Jews undermining the sovereignity of the ethnicities in the region by declaring a Jewish state unilaterally, then the contiuned oppression and abuse by that very Jewish state to secure its safety and that no retaliation would happen. Guess what that leads to? A hateful people who have grown up in refugee camps and poverty. So no I would not point fingers at them now and say "look at how barbaric they are" when they have created that very sentiment themselves.

I was always a supporter of Israel having the right to exist!!! Knowing the TRUE history of the region, I am not shocked by the heinous and horrific crimes against humanity being perpetrated by these monstrously Evil people!!! The very day the UN declared Israel the designation as a recognized entity, they offered all whose property was within the boundaries of Israel a full right to Israeli citizenship including right to vote, own property, serve in political office, etc. Some did accept that generous offer, while many others accepted instead 2nd class citizen or refugee status and spurious and ephemeral promises made to "kill all the Jews" and award the spoils to these disgruntled "Palestinians". This very name is a lie in and of itself, as Palestine was never anything more than a regional name for a territory. From 1948 on til now, Israel has striven mightily to be able to exist and prosper despite being repeatedly attacked without provocation by those seeking her demise!

This  role of this radical far right government led by Bibi, who has a  history of warmongering in order to secure his own power at home, simply  cannot be ignored in terms of its role to the build up of this attack. I  mean Bibi got exactly what he wanted from this attack, just like Bush  and his neocons with 9/11. Remember when Bush said "you are either with  us or against us" then 1+ million people died in Iraq and the decade  long "war on terror" that gave rise to ISIS and the re-emergence of the  Taliban and other groups and carnage and death and hatred? They also  used it to take away the freedom of Americans domestically. Bibi also  has a history of doing this, and this latest attack benefits him  personally the most:

All  Bibi has ever done is warmonger and create hate. He lied about Iraq  having WMDs and that led to a war that killed over 1 million. For the  past 2 decades, every month he has been claiming Iran is 2 months away  from a nuclear bomb. And when there was actually a nuclear deal that  brought some badly needed peace and stability to the region, and Iran  abided by, Bibi vehemently tried to crush it, and succeeded, and now  Iran went from around 5% enrichment to 84% enrichment as a result, 90%  is needed for the bomb. This is what being radical and unreasonable  does: it makes things worse, not better. Extremism begets extremism:  when you double down and leave no other option for the enemy, they will  fight back using whatever way they can, dirty or not. You can criticize  them morally but you can't stop them. But this is fine for Bibi, it is  to his and his wife's:

Also,  the following shows why this attack happened, read the last part, Bibi  and his far right extremist thinking caused it, when you corner an  animal with no way out the only thing it will do is eventually lash out,  you can blame it all you want but 10 times out of 10 it will happen.  You can give moral value judgements as much as you want but it won't  practically stop these things from happening. Look how hard it is to  live in Canada, but we still have it much better than much of the world,  now imagine you are a kid in Gaza whose parents were killed by an  Israeli airstrike then you poor access to education and internet and  then you have nothing to lose and Hamas comes to recruit you and offers  you a goal in life and a sense of community. Regardless of value  judgements, practically, is this going to raise or lower the chances of  Hamas getting more recruits? Well factual historical evidence has shown  the answer to this. So you can sit here and condemn them all day, call  them terrorist, etc.. call for Gaza to get bombed even more, but this  will not change things, it will just prolong the cycle of violence.

Andreas  Kluth, a former writer for The Economist, wrote in his Bloomberg News  column that Hamas "torched Biden's deal to remake the Middle East",  arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia,  Israel and the United States would have left Palestinians in the cold,  so the group decided to "blow the whole thing up." He added that, viewed  from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that  Netanyahu's coalition partners, who opposed a two-state solution for the  conflict and would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even  at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.\[151\]

And  now Bibi wants to continue what he always did: act radical, stubborn,  he will bomb Gaza to bits and kill 1000s of civilians, creating more  hatred for Israel and will cause an even more extremist organization  than Hamas to pop up in some years. This is actually how Hamas was  created in the first place: previous Palestinian militants were less  extreme. But years of Bibi's radicalism and continuous expanding of  illegal settlements (that even the USA criticized!) and mistreatment of  civilians in Gaza, restriction access to water, electricity, basic  infrastructure, policing their every movement with 1000s of checkpoints,  humiliation, suffering, etc..  ultimately pissed off and humiliated the  people in Gaza so much that they chose Hamas to represent them.

If  Israel is truly a democratic and civilized country they need to rise up  to the occasion and show this. The only way to break this cycle of  violence is to act rational and reasonable, and do things differently.  If they start treating people in Gaza with more respect and allow them  to improve infrastructure and living standards, and stop their radical push for unlimited illegal expansion of settlements, eventually extremists  like Hamas will lose support and there will be less hatred and more  peace. A civilized democratic country does not "torture back".. they say  we will not stoop to their level, we are better than this, and we will  abide by international law. Bottom line is, something has to give for  there to be change/to end this cycle of hatred and violence, and  unfortunately with far right radical power hungry leaders like Bibi this  cannot happen.

While the surface level conflicts are about land and resources, they are fueled by religious dogma.

We've seen the horribleness of Hamas committing war crimes, because its been lived streamed. Portraits of victims where shown smiling, and humanized given human names and faces.

This is a very important moment in time that we should all remember. There are currently Kibbutzim that are being attacked and/or abandoned with no IDF support.

Of course the result of this barbaric attack is going to be very bloody for both sides, but your idea that things would get better if we just took “a harder stance” towards all kind of abhorrent behavior sounds laughably simple-minded to me.

On the world stage, it is still “the law of the jungle” that is in effect. This puts a strong limit on how just the interaction between countries can ever be, and it will always be extremely hypocritical. The US for example, has a far better system of society and values to offer to the world, than China or Russia. Yet the amount of abuses that the US is directly responsible for on the world stage, that runs totally contrary to those values, are more numerous than wheat in a field.

If you look at Afghanistan and how the US tried to weed out terrorism, it doesn't work. I think one day the world will see that when it comes to radical islamists, you need to end the problem decisively. Is it any better? Maybe not. What do you propose? Letting your people get butchered? Visit Gaza yourself. Walk through the streets. See if they're welcoming and tolerant of you. If everyone would go home and leave each other alone it would be preferable.  But this is real life. Some people don't get the option of rolling to the other side of the bed and moving on. At the end of the day it's my opinion. I'm not in government declaring war. I only see the suffering of civilians being glorified or excused as the actions of an oppressed people. It isn't excusable to me. Terrorism is terrorism.

This is something very condescending and ignorant to write. The Jews went through the holocaust because of antisemitism and 6 million of them were murdered because of this shit. The truth is that we have always been so hated and abused in the world that without Israel we would have disappeared from the face of the earth. The State of Israel exists because we have nowhere else to go. Besides, this land is sacred to all three religions. This country is of great importance to both sides from a national, survival, historical, cultural, and religious point of view. And Why do you think there is so much debate and destruction around this issue if "no one gives a fuck."

Please for gods sake read the hamas charter and ask yourself how you have to defend yourself against someone whose stated goal is your destruction. Don’t defend Hamas. Hamas is the fundamental cause of the misery in Gaza. It’s  not difficult to see this operation has been planned to deflect from recent internal unrest and root the people against the external enemy.  The retaliation will be severe and the civilians will pay a heavy price but that doesn’t bother Hamas because they hide behind their civilians and fight from within schools and hospitals. I urge the well meaning people of Gaza to topple this terror regime. Show that you care for the future of your children more than you hate the Jews.

You're not wrong here, I agree. There is systemic racism at play. I'm an American.

Now back to Israel, where is the MLK of the Palestinians? Rather than just assuming that Palestinian Arabs and African Americans are identical to each other, let's step back and agree that they are not. They are both fully worthy of equality of rights and respect as are all people, however there is an ideological divide that makes all the difference. The ideology that refuses to compromise and wants to cleanse the land of an ethnic group cannot be tolerated. And I'm not saying that Israel can do no wrong, far from it, Israel is fucked up.

They are here visiting, they’re lucky they’re safe, but they can’t go back. They’re in hiding. And their children only 19 and 20 have to go fight a war they weren’t prepared for. I can’t do anything to make it better, no one can. I just wish this could be over and im sure you do too.

There used to be other ideas re a place for Jewish people to settle - the main reason it ended up being Palestine was WW2 and that things suddenly started happening, that Britain pulled out because they didn't know what to do, that the European refugees were ready and simply got it done (e.g., declared the state of Israel), the Palestinian side had nothing to really counter that (as in, they were not in a state to take over from the British and organize the region), responded with the first war against Israel (together with Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt), lost it, lost territory that had been officially theirs before the war, and the rest is history. Yes it would have benefitted both sides if Israel hadn't been created where it is now, but it's not like somebody sat down and thought this was a good idea.

Israel and Palestine are two very different societies, and one of them is a lot more advanced than the other. But when it comes to the ability to dehumanize “the enemy“, they seem to be skilled at it both, and especially when put under pressure. This is of course not anything unique to the region, but basic human nature.

Never said it makes it right. I find it abhorrent. I just wanted to convey that it wasn’t Hamas but what Muslims are taught they should do to please Allah. If it was any other Muslim army/group in place of Hamas, they would still do the same. They would still strip them down, rape them and take sex slaves.  If you have to oppose something, oppose Islam as an ideology and not just Hamas.

Again, university studied. They're both disgusting, Israel is just historically more fine with killing civilians. Israel estimated 600 casualties so far. Per capita that's NOTHING compared to Palestenian civilian casualties every year. It's a little more jarring because it's an organized attack and large numbers in a single day, but 600 would be a slow year for Israel and Palestine has far fewer people. Again thanks for being exactly the kind of idiot I'd expect to reply.

Anti-Zionists are not "anti-racist". At most, they're racist against a nation you think deserves racism. The basic anti-Zionist argument, that the Jews don't deserve self-determination in their ancestral homeland, while the Palestinian Arabs do, is racist, not anti-racist.

{'neg': 0.304, 'neu': 0.696, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.9421}

The same goes for: "I oppose all forms of ethnic nation-states, I just happen, by a sheer coincidence, to only foam at the mouth about the Jewish one". That's about as "anti-racist" as someone who "opposes all crime, and exclusively obsesses over crime committed by black people as a matter of sheer coincidence". But most notably, since anti-Zionists also don't criticize Palestinian nationalism in such harsh terms (even if they do object to it), that argument is most often simply a lie.

I don't know who "us" are, but anti-Zionism's official goal is to remove the right of self-determination of the only Canaanite nation that still exists today, destroy the only state that speaks a Canaanite language as a state language, and convert that tiny sliver of Canaanite culture, to the non-Canaanite Arab identity and language of its neighbors.

The "indigeneity" and "Canaaniteness" of Anti-Zionists is limited purely to silly speeches, and arguments online. None of them actually changed their name into an indigenous Canaanite name, insisted on switching to a Canaanite language, or tried in any way to revive the culture of any specific Canaanite nation. The only ones who did that, were the Zionists.

This area is the Jewish homeland. Meaning many of them were kick from their homes over the last few thousand years to make room for them. It was honestly a reclamation than anything else. That being said I really feel for the Jews. They've had the roughest history of any single group. As they are often tormented at every turn. In their homeland they are hated by their neighbors. As they moved into Russia, and Europe they were killed by various empires in droves. Here where I am in the US they became scapegoats for economic crises over the last few hundred years. I get people were displaced. But the Jews have spent their entire history being displaced. Hamas just one of a long line of organized political opponents to the Jews. Only for one if the only times in history a significant global power is actually supporting them. Their is a peaceful way of handling things and then there is this. Between Ukraine and Israel we could be looking at the beginnings of a third World War. If Iran a huge Hamas backer gets supplied by whatever the Russians can spare or worse China we could see a massive escalation.

I’m sure if you try hard enough you would find as many if not more footage of terrorist attacks on Israeli streets, and I guess it won’t help if I tell you that Hamas is using civilian buildings to hide munitions so that the IDF will be criticized for targeting them.

I'm a genocide historian. The definition of genocide is "Any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious  group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

Just because Palestinians are oppressed don't give a reason for you to kill Israeli citizens. Not all Israelis support the occupation. To add, All Israelis must serve conscription, if you don't,  you get excluded & punished so, most just serve it. Sure, Israel has bombed,air striked Gaza but why does Hamas parade dead Israeli soldiers? Israel has never paraded a dead Palestinian body but Hamas does. Palestinians are greedy the same with Arabs.

How do you respond tho? They kidnapped probably over 100 people and killed over 700. You cant just not do anything because they are hiding behind the Palestinian population (that supports them). They need to learn a lesson, both the Hamas and the Palestinians so that they wont ever support a terrorist group. Neither way almost no Palestinian want to coexist with Israel, they are full of hate and almost all of them (I have yet to see a comment from a Palestinian that criticize what happend yesterday) wish for all jews in Israel to either die or leave. Honestly Israel should just flatten half of Gaza and kill tens of thousands so both learn their lesson that terrorism is not the way. Also anyone that doesnt completely disagree with what happened yestersay is just as bad as those terrorists so as far as I care at least 70% of the people in Gaza are flat out terrorists.

On top of that, I doubt that every Palestine is happy about the terrorism against non-believers. The announced intervention by Israel could be legal, as the Palestines are maybe unwilling to prevent terrorism, unable to or actively participate in it. This doesn't mean that Israel hadn't had decent opportunities to reinstate the legal borders. If they try this now, or in the aftermath of this attack, I can only imagine terrorism would profit from that.

The way Israels governments have conducted themselves over the years has given no chance for a viable peace which is the only solution to this as the alternative is dead Israel people and dead Palestinians which any sane peron does not want to happen .  The  biggest example being placing israel settlers in Palestinian land and slowly taking more and more control . This is not twisted logic, this is fact ! just look at the maps decade after decade and the growth of Israel and the decline of Palestine , its there in black and white . Israel has also caused whats commonly referred to as the largest open air prison in the world which is Gaza . What happened to the Isreal people this weekend is beyond words awful , heartbreaking and sickening but the same will he said for what Israel will do in retaliation.  Israel has its most or one of its most hardline governments in its history and look what's happened.

"In May 2021, Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem, began protesting against Israel’s plan to forcibly evict them from their homes to make way for Jewish settlers. Many of the families are refugees, who settled in Sheikh Jarrah after being forcibly displaced around the time of Israel’s establishment as a state in 1948.  Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah have been continuously targeted by Israeli authorities, who use discriminatory laws to systematically dispossess Palestinians of their land and homes for the benefit of Jewish Israelis.  

{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.945, 'pos': 0.028, 'compound': 0.0516}
------------

In response to the demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah, thousands of Palestinians across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) held their own protests in support of the families, and against their shared experience of fragmentation, dispossession, and segregation. These were met with excessive and deadly force by Israeli authorities with thousands injured, arrested and detained.

The events of May 2021 were emblematic of the oppression which Palestinians have faced every day, for decades. The discrimination, the dispossession, the repression of dissent, the killings and injuries – all are part of a system which is designed to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, successive governments have created and maintained a system of laws, policies, and practices designed to oppress and dominate Palestinians.

Yes. In 2005 Israël disengaged from the strip. There was a bit of hope that a neutral or peaceful coexistence would be possible. I even remember an American Jewish millionaire who bought a lot of Jewish greenhouses to accommodate the gazans with ready made agricultural infrastructure. If I remember well they were immediately destroyed. Anyways, in 2006 hamas won the elections with 44% of the votes. Afterwards they ousted the plo and took control. If you read the hamas charter you will see that their stated goal is the destruction of the state of Israel. You have to ask yourself how can I defend myself against a neighbour with those intentions, even if I am much more powerful. Wouldn’t you like to know what goes in and out his house, preferably not weapons. Even Egypt acknowledges this and has a tight control on its Gaza border. The blockade of Gaza is a direct consequence of Hamas policy of repeated confrontation with Israel, be it missile launches or terror attacks. The latest operation is also directly related to the recent civil unrest in the strip directed towards the regime. The idea is to deflect from their own mess and root the people against the external enemy. I sincerely hope for the sake of well meaning Gaza people and the future of their children that they can get rid of hamas. But what I see now on the streets of Gaza is mainly celebrations of their “victory”. Regrettably, it will be a very painful “victory”.

I think the terrorist attacks on civilians make Hamas a terrorist group. They’re not even a true military wing. Polls are irrelevant now. They’re manipulated to benefit whomever is putting them out. Donald Trump by all the polls in 2016 wasn’t supposed to come close to winning. He did. A small fraction of people from a country isn’t the country itself. Most Palestinians just want peace and recognition which was supposed to be given to them in 1947.

"Nazi" , so i am a brown  skin nazi now?, do i belong to the national socialist party now? But i am not even nationalist nor socialist nor arian so i dont understand your insult. But hey typical leftist strawman argument. In traditional islam culture is good to take the men and castrate as slaves, and take the women as sex slaves, it was super normal in the earlier jihads,and in modern time isis done it and  hamas is doing it. And more the jewish people are the native people of jerusalem, they first divided the city for the arabs and the jews but the the arab world tried to exterminate the jewish, israel won and then the arabs posed as victims. The palestinans vowed to kill all israelis, but when israelis defend themselfes they are the bad guys. Low iq creates people like you, that just dont have the hability to read the actually history.

Let’s say your intelligence has identified a terrorist attack that’s going to happen. These men are planning to sneak across the border, raid a village, and kill innocents. You know exactly where these men are hiding. The only way to stop innocent Israelis from dying is to take them out.

{'neg': 0.254, 'neu': 0.632, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': -0.8834}

The problem is that they’re hiding in an apartment building. So you drop leaflets on the apartment building, alerting civilians that it’s about to be bombed. The civilians choose not to leave. They stand by the terrorists who are planning this attack.

This is a very realistic scenario that Israelis face all the time. Sometimes, Israelis do bad things too. And when Israelis commit war crimes (and they absolutely have) they should 100% be held accountable.

Did you only become aware of the Israel-Palestine conflict yesterday? It has literally always been the official approach of Hamas to hide behind civilians (as in: kill their own children) to force Israel to either leave them alone or accept civilian killings as collateral damage. There is a reason why not everyone sees this is a simple case of a victim and a colonizer.

If you say so. I'm not in a position to make that decision. I live in the real world, where the US killed hundreds of thousands of people in response to 9/11.

Out of desperation. It should not have come to this and I do not agree with the violent nature of Hamas. However looking at it pragmatically, how else should Palestine defend themselves from 80 years of a fully militarised state bombarding and occupying their land?

{'neg': 0.177, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8406}

It's complicated. Hamas kind of... murdered or drove out all their political opposition, and there's no way to verify that elections since then have been legitimate.

------------

So it's kind of a Putin situation where there are technically elections for the illusion of democracy, and there are certainly *some* Palestinians who genuinely like Hamas, but it's hard to accurately measure how much Palestinian support Hamas *really* has in Gaza and how much they are trapped because Hamas will kill anyone who tries to subvert them or negotiate with Israel.

Members of the Euro-Med Monitor team have documented in this report the killing of 204 Palestinians by Israeli army forces in 2022, 142 of whom were from the West Bank (69.6%), 37 from the Gaza Strip (18.1%), 20 from Jerusalem (9.8%), and five from the Arab localities within Israel (2.4%). It is important to note that this statistic, however, excludes the 18 Palestinians killed inadvertently during Israeli attacks—16 in the Gaza Strip, and two in the West Bank.

With 55 Palestinians killed, Jenin Governorate had the highest number of Palestinian deaths in 2022 compared to other Palestinian cities and governorates, accounting for 26.9% of all deaths. Nablus Governorate followed with 35 deaths, accounting for 17.1% of all deaths; this is due to the higher frequency of Israeli raids and the execution of other special operations in the two governorates.

August 2022 saw the most Palestinians killed in one month, with 42 deaths accounting for 20.5% of the total number of deaths, not including 16 others killed the same month as a result of local rockets falling in the Gaza Strip. The August death toll was high due to the Israeli army’s “Operation Breaking Dawn”, which lasted three days and targeted activists and sites associated with the Islamic Jihad movement in the Gaza Strip. October saw the next highest number of Palestinians killed (28), followed by 23 in April, 20 in November, 18 in September, and 17 in March, all in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

You can be as humanitarian as you want in times of peace. Once war is declared it is war. Action needs to be taken. Previously I was of the opinion that Palestine was wronged and supported them. Now I see their true face and the videos they themselves are taking and sharing. Whatever argument you have about who started it first no longer applies and will not be heard. The head of the snake has to be cut off before it grows. Sometimes, in doing good, there will be some evil. It's not a black and white world.

I am not advocating anything. I have long thought about this conflict, but I see no solution to it. Other than lots of blood and suffering and then either Israel eventually occupying all the land and evicting the people who live there, or their nation getting destroyed in a horrible regional war.

What I responded to was your idea that things could have been better if we had just been more strict against extremism. Islamic terrorism is a factor in this conflict, but it is not at the heart of it. It is instead about the interests of the Israelis as a people and a interest of the Palestians as a people. And of the interests of the countries surrounding them.

I’m not someone who tries to brush away the threats and problems of Islamic extremism. I am in favor of severely reducing the amount of immigrants to Europe from Islamic countries, partly because of the many problematic aspects about Islam. But in this conflict, religious extremism is an important factor that influences several things, but it is not the real driver of it.

My ass, they need money for humanitarian aid but have enough for thousands of missiles. And even if it were true, the effect of the auf seems to be zero. If it's up to me, they should be cancelled right now at the very latest.

I appreciate your points, some have merit, such as people in this thread reflecting bias and hypocrisy, however, I’m not accusing YOU of celebrating murder, but Palestinians are, Muslims in London and all around the world ARE. If they could see it as you do, I doubt they would. But the fact is, they don’t. And yea neither side is right or more deserving of justice, they both have been wronged. But at this point in time, Hamas invaded Palestine. They have done things at least publicly, that I have never seen IDF do. Come on, how can we deny that?

Unfortunately, that is not the case. This conflict would have long ago ended were this were true. Gaza and the West Bank are good starting points for a State, combined with some land swaps in the proposed peace deals. In time security measures would wane and commerce and prosperity would ensue. But, the conflict continues because they want all of it. And so they continue a policy of terrorism and murder.

Sinn Fein had one of the only reasonable press releases about this subject that I've seen. Israel has the power to exterminate every last Palestinian immediately. They have the weapons to do it, and with this latest attack, it seems they have a way to justify it. Sinn Fein calls for 3rd party intervention. If left alone, this conflict will only escalate, and there's a severe imbalance of arms and training between the two parties, so it will only end in the extermination of all Palestinian people, whether civilians or combatants. If a 3rd party keeps Hamas away from Israel and the IDF away from Palestine, we can hope for a cessation of fighting and perhaps an end to the illegal settlements, brutal policing, rationed water, and restricted movement we've seen grow over the last 50 years.

Yes, you *can* expect armed forces not to blow up civilians. It is against the Geneva Convention, and there are alternative methods to capture and dispose of enemy ammo dumps from blowing them up with civilians in them. Even the US didn't simply bomb every civilian target they suspected of containing munitions in Iraq and Afghanistan, they captured the dumps and usually exploded the ordinance themselves. To be clear: targeting civilians is unequivocally wrong. When the redcoats fired into crowds of Bostonians, that was wrong. When the US bombed Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Korean villages for the crime of being within 1000 miles of a conflict, that was wrong. When Ulster Unionists indiscriminately killed anyone they suspected of being a Catholic, that was wrong. When the IDF bombs a suspected ammo dump filled with civilians, that is wrong.

Hamas didn't exist before Israel.  It is Palestinians only way to fight back against Israel. If you and your family were evicted from your home. By a race of people who left the area thousands of years ago but decided to reclaim you families home.  Your family is sent to a refugee camp, fenced in, deprived of resources. Imprisoned.  Would you not fight back against the invaders.  Do you really expect Palestinians to just accept this?  Without fighting back?  It's a completely unbalanced war.  They are forced into abject poverty with no way out and no future prospects.

Are you defending the kidnapping of child by saying he supported the Israeli government? And unlike Palestine, Israel as a state doesn’t sanction the murder of Palestinian children. Some rogue IDF units may do that, and sometimes those crimes are covered up, and those are war crimes and unjustifiable. But to pretend there’s moral equivalence between the government that tried to avoid civilian casualties, and the one that *pays the families of of people who commit terrorism and venerates them as martyrs* is absolutely insane.

A fascit invasion force invades your homeland and murders and evicts you and your people, move you all into a concentration camp, they intentionally starve you of resources and destroy any halfway peaceful political movement, and they actively commit a genocide against your people while the world watches and supports them.

Israelis NEVER invaded that land. It was given to them by England, who legally owned that land. Israel then willingly gave up half of it to the Palestinians, and the Palestinians immediately started a war to take the rest of it. One side was willing to compromise. The other was not.

Go back further, it belonged to the direct ancestors of Palestinians today, the descendants of the jews that you mentioned are but a fraction of Israelis today, the majority are Europeans that can't even handle the middle eastern sun, and i Don't think the brits had any right to designate a people's land to another people, i mean it's not hard to tell that the UN are very biased in this conflict, morally,what Israel has been since the start is wrong and it doesn't matter if you are a Muslim or Jew or christian or anything else, if you are a rational an unbiased human being, it's easy to see that hamas wouldn't exist if the Zionists didn't flock towards that land

I agree that it was morally questionable to draw a state the way they did, but after the holocaust i don't think it's unfair to give the Jewish people their own land and govt so they can defend themselves.

I agree with you. It's just Hamas and Palestinian extremism is a big reason why there is no healthy Palestine, of course the occupation also a big one. There have been terrorist attacks since the 1920s. As you say, it's a cycle and the important thing is to break it. Sadly, now it's not the time for peace, since no leader has been serious about talking and Hamas just decided to cancel any opportunity they had with Saudi Arabia normalizing relations.

Islamic fanaticism comes into play because there would have been no need for a UN partition in the first place if the Palestinians had accepted the return of the Jewish diaspora from exile, to lands not being irrigated and cultivated at the time.

I agree with the last statement, but it would have made a lot more sense to give jews German lands since they're the ones responsible for the Holocaust,and even though there wasn't a "Palestine" before 1948 there were arabs, Muslims,jews,and Christians that called themselves Palestinians and they lived there, so it's kind of unfair to expect them to agree to be governed by people other than their own,if you look at how the Palestinians reacted to the jews mass migrating to the land, you would see that they were mostly welcomed until they started starting trouble with the Palestinians and the brits,

You're right, it wasn't fair on the locals who had been evicted from their lands. But that doesn't excuse killing innocents.

I never said I hoped, I said it will be free to. Innocent Palestinians don't deserve to be put in a graveyard. The pigs spitting on that girl's body do. Any Palestinian who condemns this and doesn't support it should not. Egypt should open up the borders and give Palestinian civilians refuge, but of course, they won't because no one cares. Israel will do what it has to do to protect its citizens and that is turning Gaza into a graveyard, unfortunately. Of course, the Palestinian's Arab "brothers", could provide the innocent amongst them refuge, but they won't and Israel will do what any country would do in this situation.

Idk about what all Muslims are but the founder of their religion asked them to rape non Muslim women of invaded tribes. All believing muslims do believe that Muhammad was always right and so they do support rape indirectly. It’s not my prejudice it’s just your thick mind that can’t comprehend this fact.

First of all, jews did have a say in the matter, they made an agreement with the brits that they would have that specific land, because they consider it as holy, second of all the reason why hamas kills innocent is because they're too weak to fight the Israeli army, if they had an army and a fighting chance against Israel, i would absolutely condemn their actions, but they don't, all they have are poorly made rockets and non-advanced weapons, in their view, causing the israelis casualties will make them back off and retreat, and it is somewhat effective, and even though i still think the things hamas are doing are horrible, I don't condemn them due to the fact that it's their only hope of taking back at least some of the land,and may all the souls of the innocent civilians on both sides rest in peace,and about your last statement, I don't think any country would give a replacement to the Palestinians,and it pains me to say, but even my country wouldn't do it because all the arabs are barely surviving,and non arab countries have already brainwashed their citizens into believing that all Palestinians are barbarians and terrorists, so they would not be accepted anywhere outside Palestine

The Arab World has never held responsibility for what they started. Israel and Jordan are the only two Middle Eastern nations to give some Palestinians citizenship and equal rights.

Israel isn't responsible for the brutal aggression the Arab World chose in 1947-1948. they started and waged a genocidal war as they called it "war of annihilation" against the Jewish Yishuv after the UN decision to divide the British mandate of Palestine into two states for two people: Jewish and Arab, they started the war against the Jews, lost, and paid the price. 700,000 Arabs fled because their leaders told them the new state of Israel would be defeated quickly and also to avoid the fighting. Yes, many were expelled during the fighting as their villages co-operated with the enemy and refused to sign non-aggression pacts, villages that agreed to live in peace stayed.

After the war was over the Arab states brutally expelled 900,000 Jews and thousands of Jews were murdered between the years 1948-1969.

You can’t look at the news today and say there isn’t a threat to Israel, so in that context they are justified. I wish it wasn’t that way but it is. Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan have all accepted reality.

Please explain to me exactly what defund means. Are you going to say fund things that keep people out of trouble? People will still get themselves in trouble. People will still get drunk and fight and steal and stab each other. There is a reason this slogan that was popular three years ago will never be uttered again by a serious politician.

I disagree that they do worse. They are objectively much more powerful which requires restraint. If they desired they could literally glass the West Bank. If Hamas had a nuke ask yourself honestly what would they do?

If we are honest and want to look at it thoughtfully the ones who deserve blame and don’t receive it are countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Iran. They don’t care for Palestinian lives much more than Israel. They only use them as proxies to push their domestic agenda and greater Arab hegemony. Truly in all of this the Palestinians themselves are the ones who have the least options.
