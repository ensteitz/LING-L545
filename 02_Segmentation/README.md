# Segmentation Practical:

## Instructions:

The results from the encoding practical were copied and moved here. They are stored in the file encoded\_wiki.txt .

To see the result of the segmenter, please use the following line in terminal:

'''
cat encoded_wiki.txt | python3 segmenter.py
'''

In my language, Sardinian, there were several unique challenges for segmentation --particularly in response to sentence ambiguities. Most of these were resolved. To see more, look at the note at the beginning of the segmenter.py file.

## Results:
I stored the results of this command in the file segmented\_wiki.txt.

If you wanted to store it in a file for yourself using the command line, please run this line through terminal:

'''
cat encoded\_wiki.txt | python3 segmenter.py > segmented\_wiki.txt
'''
